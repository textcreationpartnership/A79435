         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may perhaps ſeem strange, that any thing ſhould bee further adventured to the Preſſe about ſuch a common Theme or Argument, as the Doctrin of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is, concerning which, ſo many Large Volumes have been publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in this laſt Age of the World, for the clearing of it, with ſuch exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Scripture Truth, with ſuch evidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit, that it can hardly bee conceived what can bee added thereunto: Therefore to remove ſuch a ſcruple in the entrance, I ſhall ſuggeſt unto thee a few Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That although much hath been publiſhed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this point, yet generally, thou ſhalt finde, that either it hath been, handled Polemically, or in a Controverſal way, for the Confutation of many Errours and Hereſies that do contradict it, and blaſpheme it; as eſpecially the Doctrin of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and of the <hi>Socinians</hi> doth: or elſe, if Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, by laying down the poſitive Truths concerning it, Yet very briefly and ſummarily, ſo that many weak underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings conceive it only in a confuſed, but not in a diſtinct way: which had need moſt plainly and clearly to be conceived.</p>
            <p>This therefore I have endeavoured, according to opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſuch help as the Lord hath given mee, more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
<pb facs="tcp:168555:3"/>and largely to hold-forth: deſiring to condeſcend (as God hath inabled mee) to the meaneſt capacity. It was pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and prudently ſpoken by Reverend Mr. <hi>Dod, That too many Miniſters deal like unskilful Archers, that they do ſhoot over the heads, much more the hearts of their hearers, and miſs their mark, whilſt they ſoar ſo high, either by handling deep points, or by uſing of obſcure and dark expreſſions or phraſes, in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or Preaching of theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> Becauſe this Doctrin is fundamental,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> and that wherby we build upon the only foundation of eternal ſalvation, that is, Jeſus Chriſt. Now it is moſt dangerous to be miſtaken here. Yea, this is the very center of all Chriſtian Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all the lines do meet; all other Doctrins do either lead to it, or flow from it, and are preſerved by it: Hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> in all his writings, eſpecially in the Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> treats ſo largely of this point,
<note place="margin">In Praefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione in Epiſ. ad Gal.</note> and ſo <hi>Luther</hi> profeſſes, that <hi>this</hi> Article <hi>reigned in his heart, this about faith in the merit of Chriſt, from whom, and through whom, and into whom, al my cogitations do flow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi>
               <q>Yet I do not find that I have found out or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of the wiſdom of ſuch height, and breadth, and depth, but ſome weak, and poor, firſt fruits and fragments; and a little after, he ſaith, That wee had great need moſt diligently to bee acquainted with this Article, whether wee bee young or old, whether wee bee learned or unlearned; for this rock muſt needs be cryed up (that is, Chriſt held forth in the Juſtification of a ſinner) which, if that men ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would ſpeak of, and extol: And again, This Doctrin can never be ſufficiently handled, and inculcated: for that, it being thrown-down, or ſinking, the whole knowledge of the truth together is caſt-down and periſhed: But when as this Doctrin
<pb facs="tcp:168555:4"/>flouriſheth, all good things flouriſh; as the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and glory of God, the certain knowledge of all ſtates &amp; things. Accordingly <hi>Chemnitius</hi> ſaith that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification is, as if it were the Caſtle and chief bulwark of the whole Doctrin of Chriſtian Religion, which being either darkned, or adulterated, or over-thrown, it is impoſſible to continue the putiry of the doctrin in other points: But this doctrin being kept and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved intire, all Idolatries, and Superſtitions, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever corruptions are found in other points, do fall to ruine.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> Becauſe my place and particular imployment (wherein I hope that my deſire is to ſerve the Lord in truth, and to ſeek the great benefit of youth,
<note place="margin">Eph. 6.</note> and Students, who are to be trained up, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; that is, in the doctrin of the Lord, that may put a right underſtanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.) I ſay, that my particular imployment hath moved mee to repreſent this doctrin of Juſtification as a Standard of truth and ſalvation to them; which they ſhould hold faſt, and as the Lord ſhall call them thereunto, hold forth in their generations, for the benefit of the Churches of Chriſt, as they ſhall find it conſonant to the analogy of faith in the Scripture of Truth.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4</hi> In regard of long experience in miniſterial work, I have found, not only prophane or civilized perſons, but even many ancient Profeſsors extreamly ignorant in this point, and having only ſome confuſed notions, and general impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite underſtanding and faith, which is much to bee lamented, eſpecially in theſe daies of light and knowledge, and places of pretious liberties and opportunities: and which is worſe, it is extreamly dangerous to ſuch perſons in regard of their everlaſting eſtate, This being life eternal to know the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, <hi>Joh. 17.3.</hi> For the removing and avoiding of which

The whole diſpute of the Apoſtle may be reduced to this Reaſon;</p>
            <p>Men are juſtified either by Nature, or by the Law, or by the Goſpel:</p>

This is grounded upon <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.

            <p>For the better underſtanding whereof, we are to know, That
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168555:6"/>where we ſay God the Father is the Fountain of our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may be conceived in two reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In way of oppoſition to the other perſons of the holy and <hi>undivided</hi> Trinity.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In oppoſition to the Creatures.</p>
            <p>Object. 1. In oppoſition to the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which will be cleared in anſwering this objection; <hi>All the works of the Trinity that are without the God-head, are undivided, but Creation, Redemption, Juſtification, and Sanctification, are works without the Trinity, or are acted and terminated on the Creature as their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and all the Perſons in the bleſſed Trinity do work together in the effecting of them, ſo that one and the ſame work is ſometimes attributed to the Father, ſometimes to the Son, and ſometimes to the Holy Ghoſt; yea what things the one doth, the other is ſaid to doe alſo,</hi> Joh. 5.17. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work;</hi> and verſ. 19. <hi>Whatſoever things the Father doth, theſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe;</hi> how then can the Father be the <hi>Fountain in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Father is the Fountain of Juſtification, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Son, and Holy Ghoſt, from being cauſes in it, (for it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Yee are ſanctified, yee are juſtified, in the name of our Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God</hi>) but ſhewing, that the Father is the <hi>original,</hi> in the <hi>action</hi> of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Or, that the Father is the firſt in <hi>order of working.</hi> So <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. <hi>The Son can doe nothing of himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13, 14. <hi>The Spirit ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> ſo the Father juſtifieth <hi>through</hi> the Son <hi>by</hi> the Holy Ghoſt, the Holy Ghoſt juſtifieth <hi>by</hi> himſelf, <hi>from</hi> the Father and the Son, the Son juſtifieth <hi>from</hi> the Father <hi>by</hi> the Holy Ghoſt, and that upon two grounds,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe the Father is the Fountain of the Trinity, and as the Perſons are in order of <hi>ſubſiſting,</hi> ſo they are in order of working; but the Father is firſt in order of ſubſiſting, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. ſo alſo he is in working.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The Father was the Perſon, that moſt properly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, was offended by ſin; hence it is ſaid, that Chriſt is an Advocate to the Father, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. the Father is in this caſe the Judge, the Son the Advocate.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:168555:7"/>
            <p>The Creation, which is eſpecially aſcribed to the Father, is wronged by ſin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Father is the Fountain of Juſtification in oppoſition to the Creature, for juſtification (as it is in man) is meerly paſſive, and therefore doth pre-ſuppoſe the action of another juſtifying us: and of whom but of God? as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.30. <hi>God is one who ſhall juſtifie, &amp;c.</hi> And again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>God would juſtifie, &amp;c.</hi> and that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Thoſe whom he called, he juſtified, &amp;c.</hi> Hee that juſtifieth is the ſame with him that calleth, and predeſtinates, and that is God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What are we to underſtand by the juſtification of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the ſight of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> God is ſaid to juſtifie a Sinner, not becauſe he doth infuſe righteouſneſſe, or makes him fit to doe ſuch things as are juſt, which is the error of the Papiſts: placing juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion firſt <hi>in the infuſing the habits,</hi> and then in the <hi>Acts</hi> of Grace, or good works flowing from thoſe habits; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they intermingle a kind of <hi>remiſſion of ſin.</hi> But God is ſaid therefore to juſtifie, becauſe by his judicial proceedings or ſentence he abſolves, and acquits Sinners from the guilt of ſin, with the puniſhment thereof; and accepts them as juſt perſons unto life eternal. This might be many ways proved, but for brevity ſake, reſt in this. That juſtification in the Scripture, is wont to be <hi>oppoſed to accuſation,</hi> and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But to what purpoſe ſerves Chriſt then in the Popiſh Juſtification?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Hee hath merited that grace for ſinners, that they might merit and juſtifie themſelves; but herein they make Chriſt the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non</hi> (as Logicians ſpeak) that is, ſuch as hath no real influence on the effect; yea they aſcribe more to the good works of ſinners, than they doe to the merits of Chriſt: for Chriſts merits (by their Aſſertion) doe but make us <hi>juſtifiable;</hi> which is a woeful deluſion, and at the beſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But doth it belong to God only to juſtifie?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. How can it be otherwiſe, ſince it belongs to none to juſtifie, but to him to whom it belongs to judge? now the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168555:7"/>Lord is the ſupreme Judge, all power of judging, in Spiritual regards being taken from the creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? to his own Maſter hee ſtands or falls.</hi> And verſ. 10. <hi>Why doſt thou judge thy brother? we ſhall all ſtand before the Judgement Seat of Christ.</hi> Mortal man muſt not be an everlaſting Judge; yea the Apoſtle goes further, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. and ſaies, he paſſes little to bee judged of them, or by mans judgement; yea (ſaies he) <hi>I judge not my ſelf:</hi> i. e. no other man had power to judge him, nor himſelf to judge himſelf, who then hath power? And <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. to ſhew who was the Judge to pardon or condemn, he ſaies, <hi>Hee that judgeth me is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 It appears from the nature of juſtification, in that the word juſtification is taken from <hi>Courts of Juſtice,</hi> and juridical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in Scripture uſe, and ſignifies the ſentence of <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> and is oppoſed to <hi>condemnation,</hi> Prov. 17.15. <hi>To ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the wicked, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 143.3. <hi>Enter not into judgement, &amp;c.</hi> and in the text it ſignifies <hi>remiſſion of ſins, and imputation of righteouſneſſe;</hi> ſo that none but God can juſtifie, becauſe none but God can forgive, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.7. and God takes it to himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I have put away thy tranſgreſſions, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 4.6. <hi>God</hi> imputeth righteouſneſſe without works. <hi>God</hi> muſt doe it, or it will never be done. Beſides, in juſtification there is the <hi>Will</hi> of God not to puniſh, or not to impute, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. and a diſcharge from the Curſe and Wrath of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It appears by the <hi>Concomitants</hi> and fruits of juſtification, which God only can beſtow; as bleſſedneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. communion with God, peace of conſcience, joy in the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.3. and freedome of acceſſe to the Throne of Grace; but who keeps the key of Gods Preſence-chamber but himſelf? Who can admit us to communion with God but himſelf? Spiritual bleſſings and priviledges are farre out of the reach of any Creature, and have no Steward but Gods own Spirit, from whence this joy is called, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>The joy of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Let this ſerve for <hi>confutation</hi> of ſuch, as either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide juſtification between God and man, or elſe utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude God from being the <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe: of which ſort are the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168555:8"/>Papiſts, who fancy a double juſtification: Firſt, in infuſing <hi>habits of grace,</hi> whereby they are <hi>prepared</hi> to juſtifie themſelves, the Lord of his grace <hi>purging away their ſins.</hi> Of this they grant <hi>God</hi> to be in part the <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe, joyning mans <hi>free will concurring</hi> with him, as a burthen too heavie for God alone to bear; which is (in truth) that which Proteſtants call <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Secondly, in <hi>improving</hi> their gracious habits or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties infuſed, whereby they are every day more and more righteous: and in this they place their merits for eternal life. And in this juſtification (which is in truth that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants call Sanctification) they deny God to be the efficient cauſe. But the Scripture makes but one Juſtification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one God is the Author, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.30. <hi>Seeing it is one God that ſhall juſtifie, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. All the faithful are juſtified alike. And this admits not of divers degrees, but is <hi>all at once,</hi> though the manifeſtation, ſenſe, and aſſurance of it, may be by divers degrees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This may ſerve for unſpeakable terror, to all that have lived in enmity and rebellion againſt God, and <hi>ſtill</hi> goe on in their grievous provocations. Whom doe they provoke to anger? Is it not the Lord, who alone doth and can juſtifie a ſinner in his ſight, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.12. <hi>There is one Law-giver, that hath power to ſave and to deſtroy:</hi> there is none elſe that hath either power or authority to ſave a poor Sinner from Death or Hell. God ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.7. <hi>I will not justifie the wicked, i. e.</hi> that ſtill goe on in their wickedneſſe, and none can doe it beſides him. Many vile wretches will either deny, or juſtifie <hi>themſelves</hi> in their wickedneſſe (as it is ſaid of the Phariſees,
<note place="margin">Self juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers in a ſad eſtate.</note> 
               <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. &amp; 10.29.) and with the Harlot in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> can carry it out, with their lyes and brazen faces, and purſe, and friends, in earthly Courts, and whatſoever their cauſe is, will finde ſome like themſelves to acquit them: but theſe are but inferiour Courts, the Cauſe muſt bee tried again in an higher Court, before the ſupream Judge, from whom there can be no eſcape, whoſe ſentence no creature can avoyd or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide. Hee knows all hearts, and mens privie pranks, who will juſtly condemn what the world hath unjuſtly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and force them to ſay with <hi>Job</hi> 9.20. <hi>If I juſtifie my ſelf, mine own mouth ſhall condemn me;</hi> yea know, thou juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168555:8"/>thy ſelf (O vile man) (as <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 32.2.) more than God: and in juſtifying thy ſelf condemneſt the Lord. Yea, nothing doth more hinder thine own juſtification, than thy <hi>ſelf</hi>-juſtification, for what careſt thou for another to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee, that canſt doe it thy <hi>ſelf?</hi> as the Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. went away unjuſtified, becauſe he juſtified himſelf; while the poor <hi>ſelf-condemning</hi> Publican was ſent away rather juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for that remarkable reaſon, becauſe hee abaſed himſelf. And thou diſanulleſt Gods Judgement, and condemneſt him that thou mayeſt bee righteous, <hi>Job</hi> 40.8. thou bringeſt the <hi>Lord</hi> to thy barre, to ſtand as <hi>guilty</hi> before thee.</p>
            <p>Many pleaſe themſelves, that they are juſtified by their companions and fellows, becauſe their iniquity is ſecret, and hath eſcaped the view of man; but alas! the Malefactor ſhall not ſpeed according to the ſentences of <hi>Fellow-priſoners,</hi> but according to the ſentence of the Judge. <hi>Paul</hi> cries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. What doe you tell me of <hi>mans</hi> judgement? this is the prophane mans day, and the proud mans day, but the Lords Court-day is coming, when hee ſhall bring to light the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things of darkneſſe, and then you will bee <hi>ſelf-damned, Tit.</hi> 3.11. thy <hi>conſcience</hi> ſhall ſet thy ſins in order before thee, and thy <hi>abetters</hi> in ſin ſhall curſe thee, as the <hi>Shechemites</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward curſed <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Judg. 9.27. The <hi>Devil</hi> ſhall lay the load of all thy ſins upon thee, to bring thee to deſpair, (and it may be) to the Halter, as he did <hi>Judas;</hi> yea, the <hi>ſenſeleſſe creatures</hi> ſhall riſe up againſt thee, the <hi>ſtone</hi> out of the wall, the beam out of the timber ſhall cry out againſt thy ſins, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.11. every <hi>Sermon</hi> thou haſt heard, yea the <hi>duſt</hi> of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters feet ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt thee, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.5. but (that which is worſe than all) <hi>God</hi> himſelf will bee a ſwift witneſſe againſt thee, <hi>Malac.</hi> 3.5. his mercy, patience, and long ſuffering ſhall condemn thee, and his ſentence of everlaſting deſtruction ſhall certainly paſſe againſt thee, and then thou wilt finde <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> words too true, <hi>cha.</hi> 23. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>The anger of the Lord ſhall not return, until hee have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart,</hi> and though thou wilt not <hi>now</hi> conſider it, yet <hi>in the latter days thou ſhalt conſider it perfectly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. It is a ground of ſtrong conſolation to poor penitent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168555:9"/>Sinners,
<note place="margin">Comfort to penitent ſinners.</note> that God the Father juſtifies; againſt whatſoever the World or Devil can lay to his charge. The Apoſtle challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges World and Devil to doe their worſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who dares lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?</hi> let them bring in what Bills of Complaint, Accuſation, or Indictments they can invent againſt the poor ſoul (and they will invent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) yet they ſhall not hurt; Why? becauſe it is God that juſtifieth, And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2, 3. I paſſe not to be judged of you, or of mans judgement. Men will have their Court-days, to judge the Saints; there is many ſuch a Court kept in the <hi>Chimney corner,</hi> over the Pot, thither they ſummon and cite Gods ſervants to be tried; they ſit on their perſons, or names, or eſtates, and give them their doom; but let not the Chriſtian paſſe for mans day which way the cauſe goes; there is another day behind, which is the Lords Day of Judgement, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. and then he that is holy ſhall bee happy, and he that makes conſcience of his ways ſhall bee acquitted for ever. This makes <hi>Iſaiah</hi> exceeding confident, <hi>chap.</hi> 50.8, 9. becauſe <hi>he is neer that juſtifieth me, who ſhall contend with me? Let us ſtand together, who is mine adverſary? let him come forth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lord will help me;</hi> Who ſhall condemn me? Loe they all wax old as doth a garment, the moath ſhall eat them up. It is a pithy compariſon. Many will profeſſe, they will ſtick as cloſe to ſuch and ſuch profeſſors as the garments to their backs; many ſpick and ſpan new accuſations laid to the charge of Gods people, ever and anon: Well (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) all ſuch Accuſations will be ſoon worn out, ſoon moath-eaten, they have a worm in them, that will ſoon conſume them, and then God will bring forth their righteouſneſſe, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.6.</p>
            <p>This ground of comfort is three-fold.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 The Word tranſlated <hi>freely;</hi> in Scripture ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, is oppoſed to the hoped for, and intended end, and ſignifies in <hi>vain,</hi> or to no purpoſe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>ult.

            <p n="2">2 It is oppoſed to an <hi>unjust cauſe,</hi> and ſo it ſignifies <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a cauſe,</hi> Joh. 15.25. <hi>they hated me without a Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 It is oppoſed to the payment of a Sum of money, or a full price, as <hi>Laban</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 29.15. <hi>Becauſe thou art my brother, ſhouldeſt thou therefore ſerve mee for nought? tell mee what thy wages ſhall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 It is oppoſed to <hi>deſert</hi> either good or evil: So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.5. Jonathan <hi>ſaid to</hi> Saul, <hi>wherefore wilt thou ſin againſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud? to ſlay</hi> David <hi>without a Cauſe, or without deſert.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:168555:11"/>The word is here taken in the laſt acceptation: for the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is; That wee are <hi>juſtified without any merit</hi> on our part; So that the word <hi>[freely]</hi> is added, by way of explication of grace, and juſtification by it.

                  </gap> oſum eſſe, miſereri.</note> Eph. 2.8. <hi>By grace yee are ſaved, not of your ſelves:</hi> and indeed the Hebrew word for Grace, comes of a Root that ſignifieth to ſhew mercy, or bee merciful; And 2 Paſſively, ſo it ſignifies the gift by grace, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. where is mention of the grace of God, and the gift by <hi>Grace,</hi> that is, inherent gifts and graces that the Lord beſtoweth upon us; as Eph. 4.7. <hi>To every one is given grace, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Pet. 4.10. <hi>as every one hath received the gift.</hi> Now that grace is here meant in the former ſenſe, and not in the latter (as the Papiſts would have it) for the habits of grace infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Us: It may appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe otherwiſe there ſhould be ſome contradiction in the Text, to ſay that we are juſtified <hi>freely,</hi> and yet to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by inherent grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In the next foregoing verſe, it is ſaid, that <hi>all</hi> have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: how then is juſtification poſſible by inherent grace, where there is none; ſo that by grace here is meant the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>How can we be ſaid to bee freely juſtified, when the precious blood of Chriſt is paid to redeem us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 It is altogether free on <hi>mans behalf,</hi> becauſe no price, for our juſtification, is exacted at our hands: but on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:168555:11"/>Chriſts part it was not free, becauſe hee paid a full price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It was free on Gods part, 1 Becauſe nothing but his free grace, could move him to ordain ſuch a propitiation for ſinners, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. 2 Nor to make revelation of it to ſinners, for there are multitudes in the world, to whom this Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never was revealed; but are ſuffered of God to dye in their ſins, and to walk in their own waies. 3 Nor to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to particular perſons, and infuſe Faith: for though Chriſt paid the ranſome, yet it is <hi>free grace</hi> that it is imputed to <hi>Us:</hi> And that without our help he works faith in <hi>Us,</hi> to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the merits of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears by the Explication, That all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty before God; though Chriſt paid a great price to the Father, by way of ſatisfaction to his Juſtice, in redeeming the Elect: Yet in reſpect of Us, it is altogether free and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and that his meer free grace moved him to ſend his Son, to take our nature upon him, and to lay down his life to redeem Us. From which Explication wee gather this Doctrin.</p>
            <p>Doct. 2 <hi>That the Juſtification of a ſinner before God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Juſtification is of free grace.</note> 
               <hi>is to bee aſcribed meerly to the free grace of God.</hi> Which the Apoſtle hints twice in the Text, telling us wee are juſtified <hi>freely</hi> without deſerts; and by <hi>Gods grace,</hi> and favour to us likewiſe; which truth wee ſhall further ſee, in the ſeveral Acts of God about it, revealed in the Scripture, as</p>
            <p n="1">1 In the <hi>Decree of it,</hi> in the Council of Gods election, which (I conceive) is meant in <hi>ver.</hi> 25. whom God <hi>fore-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed;</hi> There is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or eternal purpoſe of God, which was of his meer grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. Juſtification of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then through faith, is attributed to the love of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In the determination of the work to Chriſt our head, to dye and riſe again from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> So it was free grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In the effectual application of Chriſts merits, and in our actual vocation, when true faith is wrought in the heart, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.7, 8. ſo free grace is apparent.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In the ſealing of it up to the heart, when as the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:168555:12"/>5.5. all which are implyed, or expreſſed in the Text.</p>
            <p>Proofs for the Confirmation of this point abound; as <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. <hi>After that the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c.</hi> kindneſs and love of God are aſſerted, as the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or <hi>impulſive</hi> Cauſe, of our Salvation; but not a tittle of the works of righteouſneſs in our ſelves taken notice of: and verſ. 7. <hi>Juſtified by his Grace, wee ſhould bee made Heirs,</hi> Eph. 1.6, 7. <hi>To the praiſe of the Glory of his Grace, wherein hee hath made us accepted, in his Beloved, in whom wee have Redemption, &amp;c.</hi> Which grace farther appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That God proſecutes not his Cauſe againſt us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>rigour of the Law,</hi> and his <hi>vindictive juſtice:</hi> but leaves any place, ſpace, and probability for Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That being the Party offended; hee ſhould yet appoint the manner, and means of our Reconciliation.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That hee ſpared not his beloved Son, nor any care to effect this Reconciliation.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That hee (without any dignity of ours) ingrafts us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Son, and makes us partakers of his righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Queſt: <hi>Why is a ſinner ſo freely juſtified?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1 Becauſe it was impoſſible for the Law, or any legal Righteouſneſs to juſtify ſinners, Rom. 8.3. <hi>That which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the Law, in that it was weak, through the fleſh, the Lord ſending his Son, &amp;c.</hi> Exact righteouſneſs free from Spot, the Law required, or it could not juſtify; But ſinful man, through the fleſh, that is, corruption of his heart, and inclination to evil, could not ſo obſerve the Law, as to attain to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs: becauſe Eccl. 7.20. <hi>There is not a juſt man upon Earth, that doth good, and ſinneth not,</hi> much leſs can any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2 To remove two inconveniences, 1 To exclude boaſting, 2 Thoſe terrors of Conſcience, which otherwiſe ſinners muſt needs bee ſubject to, whilſt they live in the world.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Boaſting is excluded, Rom. 3.27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? it is excluded. By what Law? by the Law of Works? No, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> Juſtification by works, puffs up the proud heart of man, with a Conceit of ability to juſtify himſelf; as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:168555:12"/>the Doctrin of the <hi>Pelagians, Papiſts, Arminians</hi> doth: They can anſwer that queſtion, 1 Cor. 4.7. <hi>Who hath made thee to differ?</hi> I have made my ſelf to differ; this breeds pride; but juſtification through free grace, laies low, having nothing of our own, but all of free gift.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Terrors of Conſcience are excluded, which Legal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe expoſeth to, 2 Theſſ. 2.16. <hi>God hath loved us, and given us everlaſting Conſolation through Grace:</hi> but without grace our Caſe is deſperate, Rom. 4.15. <hi>The Law worketh wrath.</hi> Hence intelligent Papiſts are driven to horrid extremities, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to deſperation it ſelf oftentimes: Hence thoſe <hi>large allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi> which in their Caſes of Conſcience, their Caſuiſts uſe to give men, about the breach of the Law. Hence their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>venial</hi> ſin. And they uſe to renounce their Principles at their death, and fly to free Grace, living in one Religion, dying in another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3 Becauſe thoſe things that are conferred in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot bee deſerved, but muſt bee granted by free fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; as <hi>Remiſſions of ſins,</hi> and <hi>imputation of divine righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> for ſo it is call'd, Rom. 3.22. <hi>The Righteouſneſſe of GOD without the Law.</hi> Now nothing in a finite Creature, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve or procure, that which is of infinite worth, and eternal duration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Of refutation of that Popiſh Doctrin of Merit,
<note place="margin">Popiſh merit of Congruity and condignity refuted.</note> and firſt of their merit of <hi>Congruity,</hi> as a neceſſary and acceptable Preparative to juſtification, which is a meer Dream.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe without faith 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. but this merit is before faith is infuſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The tree muſt needs bee good before the fruit can bee good, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.18. but yet the man is not ſanctified.</p>
            <p n="3">3 God accepts not the offerer for the gift, but the gift for the offerer. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4.</p>
            <p n="4">4 When the Conſcience is defiled, all things are defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 4.15.</p>
            <p>Now for their merit of <hi>Condignity,</hi> wherein their righteous works, done by a righteous man, make God a Debtor to them, and he in <hi>Juſtice,</hi> is bound to juſtify them; conſider only, Rom. 11.6. <hi>If by grace, it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no grace: but if it bee of works, it is no more of grace, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:168555:13"/>work is no more work,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Papiſts are Martyres Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli.</note> i. e. grace and works are flatly oppoſite to each other, Gal. 5.4. <hi>Yee are faln from grace;</hi> that is (ſaith <hi>Luther</hi>) as hee that falls out of a ſhip is drowned, &amp;c. and hee calls ſuch <hi>Martyrs Diaboli</hi> that undergo much, and periſh at laſt, as your Popiſh <hi>Juſticiaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. To ſhew the inexcuſable condition of all the World before God, that ſlight this admirable free grace of God. If Chriſt holds forth this free grace daily, to prophane wretches, what will become of them? what will they ſay for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at the day of judgement? that deſpiſe it, or turn it into wantonneſs? what <hi>Paul</hi> preſſed upon the Jews at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, Act.</hi> 13.38. is at this day commended to unbeleevers and prophane ones of this age. The Embaſſadors cry, <hi>Be it known unto you, Men and Brethren, that through this man is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto you, forgiveneſſe of ſins. And by him all that beleeve are justified, from all things; from which you could not bee juſtified, by the Law of</hi> Moſes. Hearken unto this all you that remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified, you that have followed lewd courſes, uncleanneſs, pride, wantonneſs, company keeping, deſpiſing of the word; bee it known unto you, that through Chriſt is preached unto you, the free remiſſion of your ſins. If any that lived civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, could be juſtified by the works of the Law, yet your hearts can tell you, you cannot: but behold, here is free Juſtification tendred you by Gods rich Grace. How long will you ſtand out and deſpiſe this Grace? As you love your own ſouls, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the mercy offered. Say yee, wee like our ſins and our profits better? then hear what follows, verſ. 40. <hi>Beware leaſt that come upon you, which was spoken of, by the Prophets: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold yee deſpiſers, and wonder, and periſh, &amp;c.</hi> that is, as your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and contempt is intollerable; ſo the Lord ſhall bring his dreadful and unſupportable deſtruction upon you; and this ſhall bee your miſery, that you ſhall not beleeve it, until it ſeizes upon you: more than ordinary judgements, both here and hereafter, follow the neglect of ſuch great ſalvation.

The Doctrin takes away the ground of your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, in ſaying, you are juſtified and pardoned freely, not onely by Gods Grace, and Mercy, but altogether freely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.16. <hi>the free gift is of many offences to justification.</hi> So verſ. 18. <hi>the free gift came to juſtification.</hi>

If juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication bee of free grace, then let carnal and prophane men ſee a little chink of light, beaming into their dungeon of darkneſs. Here is ſome poſſibility of obtaining mercy, and pardon at the Lords hands. Free Grace is the main mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Lord, for to give Remiſſion of ſin. Let it alſo bee a ſtrong Motive to you, to ſeek out after it. If free, why may not <hi>you</hi> have a ſhare in it as well as others? If the fault bee not in your ſelves, it may bee <hi>yours</hi> as well as others. Tis not ſins hainouſneſs, nor multitude can keep you out; God keeps open houſe for Grace and Mercy, and every poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, that will, may come. The Dole is not given becauſe a man hath better Cloaths, better Parts or abilities, but to poor ſouls that come to fetch it. Avoid diſcouragement and prophaneneſs, when God is diſpenſing his grace to others, as bad as thee. Go then among the crowd of Prodigals, thruſt in among them.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168555:15"/>far forth as it is accepted for us, that it being imputed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to us, God pronounces the ſentence of our abſolution, Now to open the words: firſt inquire,</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1 <hi>What is meant by Redemption here?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Redemption is taken in Scripture two waies; firſt <hi>improperly</hi> and generally, and ſo it ſignifies any deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from evil, or danger, or enemies, as it is uſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.13. <hi>Thou in thy mercy haſt lead forth thy people, whom thou haſt redeemed;</hi> The deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> is called a Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There were of old three waies of redemption: firſt by <hi>Manumiſſion,</hi> when a King doth let his vaſſal voluntarily go out free; thus we could not be redeemed, for the devil never meant to let us go free; and eſpecially it could not ſtand with Gods bleſſed nature; Holineſs, Juſtice, Truth, Hatred of ſin, thus to ſet us at liberty. Secondly, by <hi>Permutation:</hi> thus we could not be redeemed for recompence could not be made to God, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of any creature, for that infinite wrong done to him by mans ſin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. Thirdly, By <hi>violent oblation</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, as <hi>Abraham</hi> redeemed <hi>Lot</hi> by reſcuing him: but man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind might not bee redeemed by this alone, for though Chriſt might juſtly ſpoil Satan of his prey, which hee by ſubtile wiles, methods, and falſhoods, had gotten; yet mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of high treaſon againſt God, and therefore locked up under his wrath and curſe, no power was ſtrong enough, to redeem us out of his hands; but theſe are all improper waies of redemption; and too low, to reach the thraldome, mankind was faln into.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Properly,</hi> in a more ſpeciall way of Redemption; by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a price or ranſome, for a poor Captive or Slave; this is plainly ſignified by the word uſed in the Text, which hints redemption by way of <hi>Ranſome;</hi> there is <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> 2.6. <hi>Chriſt gave his life a Ranſome for all.</hi> The ordinary word uſed for redemption, is the <hi>buying</hi> of any thing again, by pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Price.</p>
            <p>Object. Some Hereticks object: <hi>Sin and Satan to whom ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are Captive, receive no price for Ranſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Wee are primarily Gods Captives, who is the Judge, againſt whom wee have ſinned, to whoſe Wrath, Curſe, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and vengeance, wee are in bondage; the ranſome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:168555:16"/>is paid to God as the Judge: Satan is but the Goaler, ſin the bonds and chains, the World and Death, as the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Torments. Wee are indeed (when the ranſome is paid to the juſtice of God) ſet at liberty, from thoſe other, in a way of power and lawful conqueſt: So Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to lead Captivity Captive,</hi> Eph. 4.8. that is, all thoſe enemies that had lead us Captive, but the price is paid to God himſelf; to whom wee do therefore pray, for the forgiveneſs of our ſins: and that in regard of the ranſome paid by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. Luke 11.21. Chriſt may bee (in ſome ſort) called, the ſtrong man armed; that is ſtronger than Satan, and ſpoils him of his goods, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2 <hi>What is meant by the Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt is prefixt with three ſeveral Prepoſitions in the Scripture phraſe. 1 <hi>For</hi> Chriſt, Phil. 1.29. <hi>To you it is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, for Chriſt; not only to beleeve, but alſo to ſuffer.</hi> 2 <hi>In</hi> Chriſt, Eph. 1.3. <hi>Who hath bleſſed us with all spiritual bleſſings, in Chriſt.</hi> 3 <hi>Through</hi> Chriſt, Rom. 7.24. <hi>Bleſſed bee God who hath given us victory through Chriſt;</hi> The reaſon of them is,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Wee have redemption <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> becauſe in Chriſt as a common ſtore-houſe, every bleſſing is firſt laid up, and then imparted to his members. As our death and condemnation was <hi>in</hi> the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> before it was applyed, or actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Wee have redemption <hi>through Christ,</hi> becauſe Chriſt doth by his obedience purchaſe it, which in due time is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us; as from the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> deſert came condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>For Christ;</hi> ſeems to bee uſed, in regard Chriſt is as well the Mediatour of <hi>application</hi> as <hi>impetration,</hi> obtaining grace for us, and working grace in us; Hence Faith and Patience are ſaid to bee wrought <hi>in</hi> the Elect. The words thus opened af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford two points.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That the juſtification of every ſinner, is through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and ſatisfaction wrought by Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That there is a ſingular and plentiful redemption wrought by Chriſt, ſufficient to make ſatisfaction to God for the vileſt ſinners. Of which in the firſt place.</p>

<note place="margin">Confutation of Popiſh partial redemption and Socinian blaſphemies that deny it.</note> as of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts that make Chriſt a <hi>partial</hi> Redeemer, and his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on imperfect, that bee ſatisfyes onely for the <hi>fault,</hi> and leaves us to ſatisfy for the puniſhment, or that he redeemed us from the eternal, but would leave us to ſatisfy for the temporal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. If Chriſts redemption bee perfect, there is nothing left to bee done by us, nor ſuffered, in way of ſatisfaction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. Chriſt ſaves to the utmoſt, and needs not our bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Socinians,</hi> they aſcribe no more than Turks to Chriſts redemption; Let us ceaſe to rake in thoſe Dung-hills, their Nomination is a ſufficient confutation.</p>

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. This ſingular redemption by Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Bondage of unregenerate.</note> neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a ſingular bondage and ſlavery, in which all unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſinners lye, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Egypt</hi> was never ſuch an iron Furnace as the ſinner is in. Were wee not enthralled, what need a ranſome? what need of redemption? bodily bondage (as in the Turkiſh ſlavery) mony might redeem; but nothing leſs than the <hi>blood of God</hi> could redeem us. See the eſtate of the ungenerate.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They are in hands of ſuch Lords, as do rule with rigour and ſeverity over them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They have not freedome of will to do any thing they could do, in their ſtate of innocency, for God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 They are forced to indure moſt intollerable things, to be born.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Lords over natural men are of two ſorts, 1 Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, 2 Miniſterial. The Principal is the moſt juſt and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible God, whoſe Juſtice they have wronged by ſin; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are ſaid to bee redeemed from under the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 7. that is from under the revenging Juſtice of the Law; As Malefactors are called the Kings Priſoners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, not the Goalers that keep them, So Sinners are Gods
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:168555:18"/>Priſoners, and who can deliver them out of his hand? but Chriſt, <hi>Miniſteriall Lords</hi> are the Devil and his Angels, and the Conſcience, accuſing, condemning, and tormenting, for ſin. Hence Sinners are ſaid, before Converſion, to bee <hi>under the Devils power,</hi> Act. 26.18. under <hi>the power of darkneſs,</hi> Col. 1.13. and <hi>taken as beaſts alive of the Devil at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. <hi>ult.</hi> Yea, God makes a mans Conſcience his keeper, going up and down conſtantly with him, haling him to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Thus the Spirit often works, through the Law, in the affrighted Conſcience; and though ſome make this their Keeper Drunk, that they may eſcape, yet God awakens him, to his former terror.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A natural man hath no ſpiritual liberty to do nor enjoy good, by any Promiſe, Ordinance, or Priviledge: his heart is weary and burthened by all, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. hee is led by the noſe as a ſlave, <hi>ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> Tit. 3.3, led along like bruite beaſts, with ſenſuality, and hurried on by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent appetite, as 2 Pet. 2.12. and chained faſt to his luſt, by <hi>the bonds of iniquity,</hi> Act. 8.23. <hi>his own iniquity ſhall take the wicked,</hi> Prov. 5.22.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Hee ſuffers innumerable miſeries and intollerable. Heb. 2.15. <hi>through fear of death,</hi> &amp;c. When a man hath ſpent his wit, youth, ſtrength, ſtate, and worn out himſelf in the Devils drudgery, when his body, ſoul and Credit are all loſt, by the Devils ſervice; what reward for his true and truſty obedience? Rom. 6. ult. <hi>The wages of ſin is death;</hi> and Pſal. 11.6, 7. <hi>Fire ſnares, brimſtone, ſtormy tempeſts, of Gods furious indignation,</hi> this is the portion of his Cup.</p>
            <p n="1">1
<note place="margin">Aggravation of this bondage of ſinners.</note> O the miſery of natural man! far ſurpaſſing that of a Beaſt; if a Dog bee chained hee howls, if the Swine bee bound hee cries, but ſinful man laughs in the middeſt of his bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage; hee counts it his liberty to live a ſlave to the Devil, and thinks to gratify his fleſhly luſts is liberty: yea, and promiſe others liberty in this courſe too, whileſt <hi>themſelves are ſervants of corruption.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.19. though they have no more liberty, than the Oxe that is lead to the ſlaughter.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They will not beleeve nor underſtand their bondage; as when Chriſt offered liberty to the Jews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32. they ſaid, they were never in bondage to any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their thraldome entered
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:168555:18"/>not into their thoughts, and they diſliked that our Saviour ſhould mind them of it. As it fared with thoſe men, that <hi>Eliſha</hi> lead to <hi>Samaria,</hi> they were bands of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> yet followed the Prophet (being blind) into the City of their enemies, thinking they had gone to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus:</hi> So it is with theſe, while the Devil lead them to Hell, where they muſt periſh, beyond all hope, and take up a room amongſt murthering Spirits, they yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they are walking towards Heaven, and defie the Devil, as having nothing to do with him, who are at the very Pits mouth, the very brink of Hell, and by no means will bee ſtopped. O beloved, Let no man deceive himſelf, imagining that if the Laws of men take not hold of him, but hee goes where hee liſts, and doth what hee will, then hee is the onely man that leadeth a free Life, but rather know, that <hi>every States Free-man, is not Chriſts Free-man,</hi> or redeemed one: No, no; there bee many that fare daintily, live in all Lieentiouſneſs, have their fill of Worldly Pleaſures, and run at randome like the Beaſts in the Wilderneſſe; that are more arrant Slaves, than thoſe that row in the Gallies of <hi>Turky.</hi> Let them turn the inſide outward, and they will finde Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of domineering Devils commanding over them. If thou didſt never feel this ſpiritual bondage, 'tis a certain ſign thou art under it ſtill, Coloſ. 1.13. <hi>Who hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. its aggravation.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In that it is of the <hi>Soul. Peter Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Chapter.</hi> 3. ſpeaks of <hi>Spirits</hi> in Priſon; a natural mans ſpirit is one of them, and ſhuts up in Sin too, which is the worſt Priſon.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Here the means of eſcape are far more difficult; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Slave may run away, or his bolts bee removed, or hee may buy his liberty; but here is no poſſibility of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Here bee more bad Maſters; they ſerve divers <hi>Luſts, Tit.</hi> 3.3. So many Luſts, ſo many Maſters. <hi>Jacob</hi> found it hard to pleaſe <hi>Laban,</hi> one bad Maſter.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Here men love their bondage; ſo that if liberty bee offered they refuſe it. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.36. Chriſt proclaimed liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:168555:19"/>to the Jews but they refuſed it,</p>
            <p>Yea,
<note place="margin">Caution to children of godly Parents not to think they are born free,</note> by way of Caution, know, That the Children of godly Parents (though they uſe to think themſelves born free, through their Parents Covenant) are not free from this bondage. It was the Jews great deluſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.33, 39. that they ſtood ſo much upon their parentage, that they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed. Chriſt tells them another ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>you are of your Father the Devil:</hi> and ſo ſaid the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, Matth. 3.9. <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, &amp;c. you are a Generation of Vipers.</hi> To ſpeak then a word in mercy to all <hi>Church-Children,</hi> and to all the Children of Godly Parents; 'Tis true you have a great bleſſing, and precious priviledges, that are born of ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but know, that this ſpiritual Freedome comes not by <hi>diſcent,</hi> Joh. 1.13. <hi>Which are born not of the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, more godly parentage makes a Childes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation much worſe, whileſt hee lies ſtill in his natural eſtate: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16.3. your Father was an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morite,</hi> &amp;c. They were in the ſight of God but as the Nations devoted to deſtruction, if they do evil, though of the ſtock of <hi>Iſrael. Manaſſes</hi> the Sonne of Godly <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> did worſe than the <hi>Amorites,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21.11. So many Children of Godly Parents are worſe than the <hi>Indian</hi> Salvages. And it is to bee feared, that when your Parents are gathered to their Fathers, as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 13. The Lord will ſtretch over <hi>New-England</hi> the Line of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the Plummet of the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and will wipe <hi>New-England</hi> as a man wipes a diſh; wiping and turning it upſide down. You have more to anſwer for, than the Indians have: you have publick priviledges and private inſtruction, and examples. Remember that the Lord will one day ſay to you, if you continue in this eſtate, as he did to the Jews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.40. you do thus and thus, ſo did not <hi>Abraham:</hi> you are lofty and proud, ſo was not your father: you follow looſe company, ſo did not your Father: you love the pot and revelling, ſo did not your father: you care not what miſchief you do to others, ſo did not your Father: you live in unclean courſes, you talk curſedly, &amp;c. as it is <hi>v.</hi> 39. if you were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children in Gods account, you would do

               <note place="margin">Trial of our redemption by Chriſt.</note> 1. If we be not in bondage to ſin: which appears in the commiſſion, and practiſe of ſin; according to that rule, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, that whoſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſin, is a ſervant of ſin.</hi> This rule is univerſally true, no man is ſet at liberty that commits ſin: and vehemently aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Verily, verily,</hi> without all controverſie: and generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, <hi>Whoſoever doth it,</hi> as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8.10. <hi>He that commits ſin is of the Devil;</hi> yet note, that committing ſin is not intended of every particular individual act, for ſo all men commit ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.8.10. the free-men of Chriſt, as well as the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves of the Devil: but of the common practice and work of wicked men; ſo 'tis, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Hee that is born of God doth not work ſin;</hi> and 'tis oppoſed to <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. where 'tis ſaid, <hi>Hee that doth, or worketh righteouſneſſe, is righteous.</hi> Now to doe righteouſneſſe is to exerciſe it, cuſtomarily, voluntarily, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately, to chuſe a righteous courſe: ſo to commit ſin, is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to live in the practice, or allowance, of any courſe of ſin, whatſoever. So that he which gives common allowance to any one ſin, can have no comfort in this redemption, but is in bondage ſtill: for ſaies <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6.16. <hi>Know you not that to whom you yeeld your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants you
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:168555:20"/>are, &amp;c.</hi> You loſe your own freedome; yea you have ſold your ſelves, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.1. <hi>Behold, for your iniquities you have ſold your ſelves,</hi> you take profit and pleaſure, and ſell the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil the eternal poſſeſſion of your ſouls; yea he holds them by conqueſt too, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought in bondage.</hi> Satan fights by tentations, and ſubdues the ſoul, ſo that it obeys him as a lawful Soveraign; as often as it voluntarily chooſes any ſin, ranſack therefore an enlightned conſcience, and it will ſoon give an Account, of liberty or bondage through the obſervation of thy courſe of life.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But may not a childe of God live and dye in ſuch a state, as</hi> David, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.9. <hi>or as</hi> Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>I am carnal, and ſold under ſin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> It is impoſſible, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. that hee that is born of God ſhould ſo ſin, becauſe the ſeed of grace abides in him, and works theſe four things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 A will and reſolution in all things to live honeſtly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A reſiſtance and reluctation againſt every known ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Watchfulneſſe about every concernment, to prevent ſin, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.18.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Reſtleſneſſe in caſe of <hi>relapſe.</hi> As in the Natural body, all is reſtleſſe, till every joynt be in its place again: ſo in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, 'tis never ſatisfied, till it come back into Gods way. Where therefore this <hi>reſtleſneſſe</hi> and <hi>reluctancy</hi> is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the ſoul is plunged, into the depths of this helliſh bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
            <p>The heart is hard to be perſwaded of this eſtate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt hath ſpoken ſo earneſtly. If thou ſeeſt not this miſery, or act unwillingly to try thy ſelf, or wouldeſt paſſe over the matter ſlightly, thou mayeſt infallibly report thy ſelf a ſlave to Satan, and ſubject to this bondage.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Conſider how Redemption is applied; of which <hi>Elihu</hi> gives an elegant deſcription, <hi>Job.</hi> 33.19. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 25.
<q>
                  <hi>Hee is ſuch a one as is pinched with his bondage, and chastened with ſtrong pain; his ſoul draws neer to the Grace, and his life to the Buryers: Then if there be a meſſenger, one of a thouſand, to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:168555:21"/>declare to man his righteouſneſſe, God will be gracious unto him, and ſay, Deliver him from going down to the pit. I have found a ranſome.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 The Lord opens the Ears to Diſcipline,
<note place="margin">How redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is applied.</note> which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quite ſtopped up.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Then he is arreſted with the Lords indignation, clapt up in priſon, and laid by the heels.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Then he looks for deliverance, and bayl, and ſome meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of glad tidings. How earneſtly doth his ſoul long for a ranſome?</p>
            <p n="4">4 At laſt the Lord ſaith, <hi>I will be gracious.</hi> Thus the ſpirit of bondage precedes, and the ſpirit of adoption follows. None ſet at liberty, but ſuch as know their bondage.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But a man may ſee his bondage, and never be redeemed out of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> True, but none miſcarry, that are <hi>painfully inquiſitive,</hi> after the means of redemption, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.7. &amp; 16.30. For Reprobates ſee their bondage and ſink under it (as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi>) ſeeking either no means, through ſluggiſhneſſe, and deadneſſe of heart, or falſe means (through folly and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.)</p>
            <p n="3">3 Conſider what reſiſtance hath been made againſt thee; in thy deliverance out of thy captivity, for none is ſet at liberty without much oppoſition. Satan like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 3.19. <hi>will not let you goe, no not with an high hand.</hi> Hee will never let goe, as long as he can hold you, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. <hi>The ſtrong man armed keeps the Palace;</hi> holds his Priſoners with all his might, till a ſtronger than he comes, and ejects him. Seek after this reſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="4">4 See what aſſiſtance of God thou haſt had, againſt all this reſiſtance by the Devil. As he <hi>ſtretched out his arme</hi> to deliver out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> Exod. 6.6. ſo he puts forth mighty power, to deliver from the powers of darkneſſe, by the ſpirit of his grace, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>Acts</hi> 26.28.

            <p n="3">3 It is dangerous to refuſe this Redemption; yet thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> 2 Chro. 36. <hi>ult.</hi> when <hi>Cyrus</hi> by Proclamation gave them all a free diſcharge, to depart from <hi>Babylon</hi> (a place where they had ſuffered grievous bondage) to their own Country, accepted not the Kings royal favour; but abode willing Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Slaves ſtill; loving <hi>Babylon</hi> more than <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> ſo after Proclamation of Redemption wrought, and at this day generally offered, many love <hi>Babylon</hi> more than <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> their bondage under the Devil, more than their liberty through Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.36. The <hi>Jews</hi> contemned the liberty, that the Son would have given to them. The people of <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> hearing Chriſt preach deliverance to captives, liberty to the bruiſed, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18, 24. at firſt admired the gracious words that came out of his mouth; yet would have deſtroyed Chriſt, and ſet at nought his counſel. So ſome love the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral news</hi> of Chriſt a Redeemer, but care not to apply it, nor
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:168555:22"/>earneſtly to ſeek it. The hired Servants might goe free, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 25.40, 41. at the year of Jubilee; but many would not goe to their families and fathers poſſeſſions, but ſaid, I love my Maſter, and like my condition; ſo that they had their <hi>ears boared with an Awle, to be ſervants for ever,</hi> Exo. 21.5, 6. Thus it is to be feared, many might bee boared for Spiritual Bond-men, and that Satan hath boared many for his Bond-men. Bee exhorted therefore, to conſider the preſent offer, <hi>Goſpel days are Jubilee days:</hi> the year of releaſe: the acceptable year of the Lord. It concerns all Bond-men to ſue out the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Proclamation, if they would have any benefit thereby. It was the moſt prevailing motive amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> to act, when their <hi>Liberties</hi> lay at ſtake, <hi>Eſtote viri, Libertas. agitur.</hi> In this quarrel they would bee prodigal of their bloud; but here's no danger, but in not contending for your liberty. And indeed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.2. The day of vengeance is joyned with the Proclamation of liberty. Oh ſee then the dreadful danger of refuſal.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhould I partake of this plenteous Redemption in Chriſt Jeſus?</hi>

               <note place="margin">Directions to attain Spiritual liberty.</note> 1. Let us bring the matter to an <hi>iſſue,</hi> and draw ſome <hi>concluſion;</hi> giving the <hi>Verdict,</hi> one way or other: that wee are in bondage, or at liberty: Satan is willing that wee ſhould leave the matter in ſuſpenſe, or elſe draw a falſe concluſion. As the <hi>Jews,</hi> Joh. 8.32. pleaded, that <hi>they were not in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage:</hi> forgetting that, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Scripture hath ſhut up all under ſin,</hi> without exception. And that all that are redeemed, are drawn up from out of the <hi>ſink</hi> of ſin, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. and that all the redeemed were taken from under all the Curſes of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. They like the eſcaped Beaſt, have (as it were) a ropes end about their neck, and fetters at their heels.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Let us ſeek liberty with courage and magnanimity; for we muſt expect diſcouragements. When we but talk of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the tale of Bricks will be doubled; and if we are eſcaping, we ſhall be purſued with all the forces of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> The Devil will preſſe hard after us, if we ſet but a foot forward for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> Hee will increaſe our durance, and raiſe all the Train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of Earth and Hell againſt us; with all the Militia in

But <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.14. <hi>Caſt yee up, cast you up; prepare the way: take up the ſtumbling-block out of the way.</hi> See your Leader in the Cloud and Pillar of Fire, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5. See the door of Hope, the valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> Hoſ. 2.14.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Let us renounce all Redeemers but Chriſt. Some think they can redeeme themſelves, by leaving their ſins, amending their lives, or excuſing their ſins, as ſmall, and making God amends for them, by duties, and ſervices: forgetting <hi>that no man can redeeme his brother,</hi> Pſal. 49.8. nor yet can any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme himſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Let us with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> cry continually in our bondage, <hi>The Lord ſaw their affliction, and heard their cry,</hi> Exod. 3.7. and ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to them, when they were at worſt, to ſet them at liberty; give God no reſt.

So did the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.16. whoſe bondage was not comparable to ours. <hi>The Crown is faln from off our heads, wee bee to us, for wee have ſinned,</hi> verſ. 21. <hi>Turn us O Lord; and wee ſhall, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 Study the truth of the Goſpel: for the promiſes ſetled on the heart by meditation, bring home the Redeemer, and ſet us at liberty, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.32. impriſon it not therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Attend the motions of Gods Spirit, in and with the Word, for it belongs to the holy Spirit to apply this Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; called therefore the ſpirit of liberty, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3.16, 17. ſlight not the ſuggeſtions of it, but follow it home into the ſoul.

            <p n="2">2 Exhortation to the <hi>Redeemed</hi> in divers particulars from this Doctrin.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To labour for a deadly hatred of ſin,
<note place="margin">Return not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Aegypt.</note> and watchfulneſs againſt it, that brought us into this bondage. Let us not be like unthankful <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that when our Ranſome is paid, and Salvation wrought, we ſhould deſire to return again into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> What is this but to deſpiſe the price paid? God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them, that he had redeemed out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> becauſe they beleeved not, <hi>Jud.</hi> 5. And will take it very hainouſly at our hands, that wee ſhould voluntarily accept that ſlavery, that he paid ſo great a price to redeeme us from. Not only a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:168555:23"/>vile converſation is now dangerous, but a vain one; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to live ſcandalouſly, but to live unprofitably. For, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>We are redeemed from our vain converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 To make continual uſe of Chriſt our Redeemer:
<note place="margin">Make continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al uſe of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> who though (by his redemption) hee freed us from ſin, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans power; yet never doth free us from their moleſtations, till the Reſurrection; when Redemption ſhall bee fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. For <hi>Canaanites</hi> are in the Land ſtill, Tentations, Fears, and Doubts moleſt the Conſcience ſtill. Remainders of corruption make <hi>Paul</hi> cry out, <hi>O miſerable man that I am,</hi> Rom. 7.24. and to ſtill his conſcience hee looks at Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, verſ. 25. <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> God will have us, <hi>continually</hi> beholding to his Son: and therefore hath made him <hi>Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. to us.</p>
            <p n="3">3 To be Servants of God,
<note place="margin">Be Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note> that hath bought us at ſo dear a rate. As the redeemed <hi>Gally-ſlave,</hi> ſhould look upon himſelf as <hi>his</hi> Servant that redeemed him. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> argues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19, 20. <hi>Yee are not your own for you are bought with a price, &amp;c.</hi> You owe your Life, and Liberty to the Lord Jeſus. You are his by right of purchaſe: be therefore wholly at his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Never was a dearer rate paid in the world. Your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſervice (though veſſels fit for your Maſters uſe) will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recompence the charge laid out upon you. You are <hi>his</hi> by Creation, and <hi>his</hi> by Redemption. Hee purchaſed your ſouls, bodies, and ſpirits: and juſtly then may he challenge all. This was the end of our deliverance, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. <hi>delivered from our enemies to ſerve him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty, wherewith Chriſt hath made you free,</hi>

Papiſts would bring us in bondage to the Law, by looking for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe from thence. Some would bring our Conſciences in ſubjection to mens inventions, but <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.23. that being bought with a price, <hi>we ſhould not bee the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of men;</hi> nor ſubject our conſciences to mens tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p n="5">5 You that are at liberty, <hi>remember them that are in bonds,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:168555:23"/>Heb. 13.3. <hi>as if you were bound with them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Remember them that are in Spiritual bonds.</note> See how many in your Families, Towns, and Neighbour-hood, goe clattering up and down in the bonds of iniquity, in the fetters and chains of the Devil. Pitty theſe poor priſoners. Give them a lift to help them out. Admoniſh the unruly, pray for them that have not ſinned unto death, that they may bee ſet at liberty. This is eminent charity.</p>

Let the redeemed of the Lord ſay ſo, &amp;c.</hi> who ever is ſilent, <hi>Let the redeemed ſay ſo.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.24. This is meant by the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Lamb, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> praiſed God, for deliverance from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the red Sea, &amp;c. how much more ſhould the Saints break forth into praiſes for deliverance from the nethermoſt Hell? Spiritual bondage is the worſt bondage: And ſoul-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is the greateſt redemption, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.23.

No love like that of Chriſt: not no love of Chriſt like that, manifeſted in our redemption. Let thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe alſo exceed.</p>

            <p>Doct.
<note place="margin">The juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Sinner is through the redemption of Chriſt.</note> 2. <hi>That the juſtification of a Sinner, is through the redemption, and ſatisfaction wrought by Christ.</hi> This truth the Holy Ghoſt bears witneſſe to, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his bloud, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of our ſins. Col.</hi> 1.14. hath the ſame words expreſly. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. wee are ſaid to bee <hi>redeemed from all iniquity.</hi> That implies, iniquity cannot be taken away (as it is in the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a Sinner) but in a way of redemption and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. <hi>What is the nature of this ſatisfaction?</hi> for the word is rarely found in Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> As it referres to men, the word is found, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.15. Pilate <hi>willing to ſatisfie the people, releaſed</hi> Barrabbas, the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; to ſatisfie, is to doe as much as is ſurficient, to him that expoſtulates, or is wronged, or to fulfill ones deſires, either by words or deeds. But as ſatisfaction hath reference to a debt, ſo it ſignifies <hi>full pay,</hi> or to give a full price. But as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:168555:24"/>hath reference to <hi>our</hi> debt, unto God, the word is not found expreſly in Scripture; but there are equipollent terms, of the ſame ſignification: as <hi>redemption</hi> here in the text: paying a price, and ranſome, &amp;c. which cannot be interpreted in any other good ſenſe, but as intending ſatisfaction. Of which nature are theſe phraſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. <hi>Hee was wounded for our tranſgreſſions.</hi> And again, verſ. 8. <hi>For the tranſgreſſions of my people was hee ſmitten.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.3. <hi>Chriſt dyed for our ſins,</hi> Heb. 10.12. <hi>Hee offered a Sacrifice for ſins.</hi> The word <hi>[for]</hi> there ſignifies, <hi>the impulſive outward,</hi> or meritorious cauſe, reſpecting the puniſhment due to our ſins. Which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In that ſin in Scripture is called a debt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.12. <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our debts.</hi> Not that wee owe ſin to God, but that it makes us liable to Gods juſtice: as Debts of mony make us liable to our Creditors, and to any juſt courſe in Law for their recovery. This debt of ſin cannot poſſibly bee ſatisfied for by man, for <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.24. it is a debt of <hi>ten thouſand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents.</hi> And the Spirits in priſon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. can for ever ſuffer, but not at all ſatisfie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Seeing all Mankind muſt otherwiſe eternally periſh; God the Father appointed, of his rich grace: and God the Son, in infinite compaſſion, condeſcends to bee our Surety, and to take the debt upon himſelf. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him:</hi> and verſ. 6. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.</hi> Charged all the ſins of the elect upon him. And Chriſt comes, of his own accord, to undertake the debt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Loe I come to doe thy will,</hi> Gal. 2.4. <hi>He gave himſelf for our ſins:</hi> Hee becomes <hi>Surety,</hi> Heb. 7.22. <hi>Jeſus was made Surety of a better Covenant</hi> (for teſtaments uſe not to have Sureties.) Hence Chriſt is made a Debtor, in mans room, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, and by conſent, as really, and truly, as ſinful man was before. Neither will the Father follow the Law, upon the poor, beggarly bankrupt, elect of Mankind: but proſecutes the rich Surety; and Chriſt muſt pay all. And though other Creditors ſtand bound with their Surety, here the Surety, [Chriſt] ſtands bound alone.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The <hi>matter</hi> of this ſatisfaction, that the Father exacts from his Son, are all his ſufferings upon earth; eſpecially his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:168555:25"/>obedience to the death of the Croſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, &amp;c.</hi> The Father requires, that the Son ſhould bear all that was threatned, to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 2.17. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 The <hi>form</hi> of this ſatisfaction ſtands in the manner thereof; which was in every reſpect moſt perfect. 1 Becauſe the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon offering was <hi>God.</hi> 2 The dignity of the offering, <hi>Hee gave himſelf,</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. 3 The merit of the Oblation, which had all perfection by the <hi>Hypoſtatical union.</hi> Hence it muſt needs be of infinite value. God and man in one Perſon, voluntarily ſtanding in the ſtead of faln man, that is of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; and drinking up the very dreggs of his Fathers Cup of indignation. So that the Father ſaith, I will bee gracious, for I have found a Ranſome, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. <hi>Hee was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him;</hi> that is, Chriſts ſufferings are the means of our reconciliation, and take away the enmity between God and us; the word is of the plural number, comprehending all peace, external, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, external. And the word will more fully ſuit the matter, if it be tranſlated (as the Septuagint hath done it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. and it will bear) retributions. The chaſtiſement of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions</hi> were upon him: that is, the puniſhment wee ſhould have paid our ſelves, hath he paid; and made all even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the elect.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But what need this ſatisfaction for our juſtification? Could not God by his meer grace forgive?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> There is a neceſſity of ſatisfaction. And though man could forgive a wrong, God could not.</p>

Yea he decreed, that his Son ſhould give himſelf a <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> for ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.11. Now Gods Decree is not to be reverſed; therefore this ſatisfaction muſt be given.</p>

               <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you again weeping, that they are enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt. Many</hi> that little thought they were ſuch; <hi>many</hi> where Chriſt is eminently profeſt; <hi>many,</hi> whom I have often warned of it; <hi>many,</hi> whoſe eſtate I bewail with tears; <hi>many,</hi> whoſe end is deſtruction: deſcribed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. men that mind only their <hi>back</hi> and <hi>belly,</hi> earthly things.

               <note place="margin">Contemners of his Word.</note> For ſuch as ſlight the Word, ſlight Chriſt, and his ſatisfaction, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48. they diſannul Chriſt (as to their own ſalvation) that receive not his word. Now it is not enough, to teſtifie, we take Phiſick; becauſe we take it in our hands, or mouthes, unleſſe we ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, to purge and cleanſe: nor that we take food, when we only take meat and ſet it by us, unleſſe we feed on it: ſo nor to have the Word in our hands, or in our ears, or heads, unleſſe it <hi>converts</hi> us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. and <hi>cleanſe</hi> us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.3.

In the mean time, not ſeeking with diligence, the <hi>Pearl of price,</hi> but putting off all upon Chriſt, and his grace, hoping that they ſhall find mercy, though they fly not to this ſatisfaction; as the Man-ſlayer, with fears, terrours, and reſtleſſe ſpeed, from the Avenger of bloud, to the City of refuge: forgetting that God will make us know the worth of a Redeemer, and of ſatisfaction by Chriſt, before wee ſhall have it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.12, 13. <hi>Hee brought down their ſtrength with labour, they fell down, and there was none to help.

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2.
<note place="margin">Faln mans miſery.</note> Let us hereby bee convinced of the miſery of faln man: whoſe ſtate is not only dangerous, but deſperate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this ſatisfaction. And yet alas! how little is it conſidered by wretched Sinners: our days are like thoſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.39. We have many <hi>Noahs,</hi> preachers of righteouſneſſe, to warn us of the evil to come; but no man takes warning. Wee are ſinging and chanting to the ſound of the Viol, while God ſounds an alarum, by the trumpet of warre. Wee are <hi>dancing</hi> in jollity, while God is <hi>marching</hi> in Battalia. We are drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Wine, and ſtrong Drink, while God is letting out our Blood. Wee are devouring the Creatures, while wee are devoured of the Creator. Wee are joyning Sexes in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, while God is ſeparating ſoul from body. Swimming in pleaſures till we are drowned in the floud; and no man takes warning, as if there were no danger in the matter; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to give you ataſte of it,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Conſider, <hi>that all have ſinned,</hi> Rom. 3.23. All without exception have been in an eſtate of ſin, and in want of that righteouſneſſe, that ſhould ſtand before God for acceptation. And though education, or a better nature ſhould ſtop ſin in ſome from bringing forth ſo early, or breaking out ſo foulely as it doth in others, yet there is no difference: there lyes a hidden Spring-head in all, both <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and uncircumciſed, binding them over to the Wrath of God. And leaſt you ſhould therefore ſay, you ſhall eſcape as well, and your condition is as good as others.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Conſider, <hi>we all are come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 3.23. come ſhort of his grace by the loſſe of original righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; and of his glory, by the ſeparation which our ſins have made. The fruition of God is the Goal of our race wee run to obtain; our ſins have caſt us behind in this race (as the Greek word there ſounds.) Juſtification by Chriſts ſatisfaction, is the only way, now left, to attain the end of our race; which whoſoever wants, muſt never hope to enjoy God.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Nothing in the Creature can juſtifie. Good Works, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Services, Prayers, Tears, Groans, are all too mean, to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:168555:27"/>make God to account him righteous; no, nor to give all his eſtate to the poor, and his body to bee burnt for Religion; for the Law required, that God ſhould bee ſerved, with all our might, and all our power, and ability; but by the works of the law can no fleſh bee juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. Moreover, by the Law ſin is known and manifeſted; but what makes known ſin, cannot juſtify from it: for 'tis madneſſe for a Traytor, when hee is convicted of Treaſon by ſome Statute, to expect an acquittance by that Statute, that condemned his Crime to Death: ſo 'tis in man, to expect Abſolution by the Law, which condemns his ſin to death. The Law therefore leaves man without all hope.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The grace of God, cannot juſtify any ſoul, without Chriſts ſatisfaction. Men may hope to bee ſaved, by Gods Grace and Mercy, but without Chriſts ſatisfaction, their hope is meerly groundleſſe. <hi>Paul</hi> names Gods grace in the Text, but addes, <hi>through the Redemption which is in Christ Jeſus:</hi> not by grace without it. The Devil would plead Gods grace, to get out of his miſery, if that would do it, as well as you. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very carnal wretch would plead it, <hi>'Tis a pretious Plea to flye to Gods grace, yet none is welcome but hee that hath a High-Prieſt,</hi> Heb. 4.15, 16. <hi>Let us come boldly to the throne of Grace:</hi> what may any poor ſoul come? Surely no, unleſſe hee hath the <hi>Therefore</hi> to the <hi>Wherefore.</hi> Unleſs hee hath a High Prieſt, <hi>that was tempted in all points like unto us:</hi> Elſe hee'le finde the throne of Grace, to bee a Judgement Seat: and may <hi>call to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to fall upon him,</hi> Revel. 6.16. to ſave him from the wrath of him that ſits upon the Throne, when hee comes to beg for grace. Nothing but the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, can procure the ſouls welcome. No gift of man can appeaſe God, Prov. 6.34, 35. <hi>The jealous God will not spare in the day of vengeance, hee will not regard a ranſome, neither will hee reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, though thou giveſt many gifts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God-man in one perſon, is alone the accepted price. The Father would not take a farthing more than his juſtice did exact, nor a farthing leſs than what was due. As where ten pound is due, the Creditor exacts not twenty; and where twenty pounds are due, hee will not accept often: ſo the father required Chriſt for ſatisfaction, being the exact return,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:168555:27"/>according to the fathers Juſtice. For Job 34.23. <hi>God will not lay upon man more than is right.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> clears him, Rom. 3.5, 6. <hi>what ſhall wee ſay then? Is there unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid.</hi> Hee is no Extortioner to take more, nor could take leſs than his due. He doth not willingly afflict the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.34, 35. much leſſe doth hee exceed in the affliction of his own Son. Now therefore if God required his Son, as an infinite price for the ſatisfaction, of his infinite wrongs, to become a ranſome for loſt man: ſurely man was faln into a moſt woful eſtate. Beware therefore, O ſinful wretch, that ſleepeſt in thy ſecurity, leaſt God cauſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire to fall on thee, this moment, as it did on <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> O what a remedileſs! what a helpleſs eſtate is thy ſoul fallen into! Let thy tears run down like a river, day and night, give God no reſt, ceaſe not to complain to him. Let thine heart like <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, find no place to reſt on, till thou haſt gotten Chriſts ſatisfaction to bee thy ſouls Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. Of Inſtruction and Exhortation to every man,
<note place="margin">Inſtruction to take the right way to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> to take the right way for Juſtification. The world hath been tampering about it, ever ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and the Devil hath ſo much over-clouded it; That the greateſt part of the World have quite miſtook it: and where there is any diſcovery of it, infinite errors have been broached with it. And the heart of man turns and windes under it, not being able to cloſe with the way of it. Bee cautelous therefore, and know; <hi>That there is no true Juſtification; but what Centers in Chriſt,</hi> Act. 4.12. <hi>There is no Salvation</hi> (not a jot) <hi>in any other; for there is none other Name given under Heaven;</hi> God the Father gave no other way, nor Name; Therefore no other Way nor Name can poſſibly bee found out. Redemption was alone, by <hi>Chriſts blood,</hi> Eph. 1.7. <hi>Hee is made our redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>Hee ſhall give his Life,</hi> Matth. 20.28. This is the great Leſſon, to learn, Chriſt your ſatisfaction to the Father. Now then as a poor man asks his Friends, how hee ſhall pay his debts, fears the Creditor will come to clap him up in Gaol, and there hee muſt lye and dye becauſe hee cannot pay, as that complaint is, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.1. ſo ask you, what you ſhall do to bee ſaved? where you ſhall find a Ranſome? your ſoules are deeply indebted, <hi>and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:168555:28"/>you have not to pay,</hi> Mat. 18.25. and the Creditor is coming haſtily upon you. O bee not more careful to ſave your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies out of Priſon than your ſouls out of Hell. Lay hold on Chriſt who alone is Current mony, and full ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhall we compaſs this ſatisfaction of Chriſt? and comfort by it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> You muſt do as the poor bankrupt doth. Firſt, to get him a ſurety to undertake the debt. Secondly, to gain to himſelf an Acquittance, under hand and zeal. <hi>Get Chriſt to bee thy ſurety,</hi> and an Acquittance written with his blood. Now an Acquittance is derived by the Lawyers, from the word <hi>quietantia,</hi> an old barbarous term, but very ſignificant: which when once it is got, the Debtor is then at reſt. No ſuits in Law, nor brangling controverſies can bee maintained any longer againſt him; for hee hath his <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> a free and full diſcharge: Plead for this from God; and that <hi>from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world to this day.</hi> For <hi>Adam</hi> left his poſterity in debt. This Acquittance is nought elſe, but what <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, Rom. 5.1. <hi>Peace in Conſcience,</hi> ariſing from Chriſts ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our ſins. And that you may attain this ſurety and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Conſider the neceſſity and worth of Juſtification. It is the <hi>Juſtification of Life,</hi> yee are dead without it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. And having obtained it, you are <hi>fit for any thing:</hi> for glory, <hi>whom hee juſtified, hee glorified,</hi> Rom. 8.30. <hi>Enoch</hi> had this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that hee pleaſed God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. then was hee fit for Heaven. Fit to bee a teacher of others. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cries, now ſend mee, when his ſins were pardoned. But without it, you are fit for nothing. If Death arreſts you, how will you ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Bail? how will you wiſh you had pleaſed God? how unfit to go off the world? O leave not that to the laſt gaſpe, that ſhould bee done firſt. Thou mayeſt bee great, and rich, and honourable, and yet not fit to live, nor to dye: but he that is juſtified is fit for both.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Highly eſteem the Ranſome. It was no leſs than the blood of <hi>God</hi> that ranſomed you. And if things are to bee eſteemed by what they coſt, nothing is more precious than this Ranſome. And accordingly the Apoſtle valued it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. hee accounted all the worlds glory, but <hi>Dirt, and dung
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:168555:28"/>in compariſon.</hi> And deſired to abandon all knowledge that hee might know Chriſt, and him crucified. How highly doth hee prize, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. Chriſt not <hi>glorified,</hi> but <hi>Crucified:</hi> mainly intending to preach that. Hence the whole work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is called, <hi>Preaching the Croſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.18. In a word, the greateſt love that God ever ſhewed to man; and the greateſt bleſſing man ever attained to, it is this ſatisfaction of Chriſt, Love with an affix, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Conſider the lenity and difficulty of the ſatisfaction. God would not have ſent his Son, if all the world could have made ſatisfaction. Iſa. 53.10, 11. <hi>Hee ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and bee ſatisfied.</hi> Hee ſaw the pay was current [the travel of his ſoul] to wit, all the ſufferings of Chriſt, gave him ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. What need Chriſt take ſuch pains, if any elſe could do it? It coſt not Chriſt half ſo much pains to make the world, Pſal. 33.9, 10. <hi>Hee ſpake the word and it was done, &amp;c.</hi> This work of ſatisfaction made him ſweat drops of blood.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Receive an unlimited Chriſt, and entertain him in all his Offices. Receive his perſon firſt, and then his benefits. Joh. 1.12. <hi>as many as received him, &amp;c.</hi> Receive him and then his adoption and ſatisfaction. Let him bee King as well as Prieſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. Take him as a <hi>ſanctifier,</hi> as well as a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> Accept his <hi>Majeſty</hi> as well as his <hi>Mercy.</hi> Take <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as well as <hi>Happineſs</hi> from him. Let the water of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration bee welcome, with the blood of Juſtification. And that with ſpeed, for <hi>Luke</hi> 14.24. if you come not when invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, you may never bee welcome. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enter <hi>Canaan,</hi> when God offered it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. had never after an opportunity. <hi>Francis Spira</hi> under dreadful torture, pittifully lamented, that now God would not give him one motion of his bleſſed Spirit more, many of which he ſlighted before. If therefore you minde eternity, and have any care of your ſouls, or any reſpect to Chriſt, or fear of God; if hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bee worth having, give Chriſt entertainment in all his Offices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Comfort to all that are in Chriſt:
<note place="margin">Comfort to ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> that your ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is paid. Lift up your heads with joy for your redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on draws nigh.</p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:168555:29"/>
            <p n="1">1 Conſider your ſins are ſatisfied to the full. Poor bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſouls, have all Bills and bonds, and hand-writings that are againſt them, cancelled, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Davids</hi> prayer is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; all his <hi>Tranſgreſſions are blotted out,</hi> Pſal. 51.12. Oh what joy! what contentation ſhould diſplay its triumph in the heart. The diſcharge of ſin, is another gates thing than all other diſcharges. The Debt is greater, the Creditor more dreadful, the Gaol more horrible, the Gaoler more cruel, and the ſatisfaction fuller, then men ever felt or found. Your Moraliſts ſay, <hi>It is the hardeſt of all ſatisfactions, for an Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to ſatisfy a Superiour, in point of honour.</hi> If hee had injured him in his goods, ſatisfaction might have been made; but what will hee do here? will hee ſubmit to him? that hee ought alwaies to do. Will hee do it by his goods? no, <hi>a good name is better than Riches,</hi> Prov. 22.1. Sin violated Gods Juſtice, and affronted his God-head. For every ſin is a kinde of <hi>Dei cidium,</hi> a murthering of God. Hence men are called <hi>God-haters,</hi> Rom. 1.30. but <hi>hee that hateth his brother is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.15. ſo is hee that hateth God. And indeed hee doth kill God, as to himſelf, for as the Sun though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loſe its light, yet is utterly eclipſed, as to the eye of man. So is God to the Sinner. But now as tranſcendently evil as Sin is, Chriſt hath ſatisfied for it; and put an end to all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to thy Conſcience about it. <hi>By one offering hee hath perfected for ever, ſuch as are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.15. God ſaith, <hi>I will bring forth my Servant the branch: and I will remove the iniquities of the Land in one day,</hi> Zech. 3.8, 9. Yee ſhall call therefore every man his Neighbour, under his Vine, and under his Fig-tree; For Pſal. 85.10. <hi>Mercy and Truth have met together, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Peace have kiſſed each other;</hi> that is, all Gods excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies gloriouſly ſhine forth in Chriſts ſatisfaction. Comfort yee one another with theſe words.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Conſider for your Comfort,
<note place="margin">Weak beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er juſtified as much as ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> That the weakeſt true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever, is juſtified as much as the ſtrongeſt. What was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to <hi>Abraham</hi> for his Juſtification, was and is imputed to the weakeſt Saint. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24 <hi>To Us it ſhall bee impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if wee beleeve on Chriſt, as</hi> Abraham <hi>did.</hi> 'Tis true, all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not this ſatisfaction alike; but the <hi>matter</hi> and form of our juſtification is all one. Therefore rejoyce O weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168555:29"/>thy cloathing (notwithſtanding all thine infirmities) is as bright ſhining in the eyes of God, as that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the greateſt Saint in the world.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How can wee come to comfort through the ſatisfaction of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Gain your Acquittance, a writing drawn with Gods own hand, with your name in it, 1 Joh. 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I writ unto you that beleeve on the Name of the Son of God, that yee may know yee have eternal life.</hi> So that if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, there is the writing, grounded on a <hi>Record,</hi> verſ. 11. and there is your <hi>Name</hi> in it. You ſee your way to finde your Names there, get it ſealed to your hearts by the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Let there bee an humble, active, embracing of Chriſt, in the Word of Promiſe. God requires, beſides his own <hi>good pleaſure,</hi> and the <hi>Councill of his will,</hi> the work of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.11. Thou muſt exerciſe thy humble, obedienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Faith, as thy day-labour: even a conflicting faith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. and a praying Faith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.32. and a confeſſing faith. As they did their ſins, laying their hands on the head of the Scape-Goat, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.21. So the hand (the type of faith) was put on the head of the burnt offering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. And an humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Faith: which indeed is the moſt humble grace of all, Rom. 11.20. <hi>Thou standeſt by Faith, bee not high-minded.</hi> From which grace Chriſt is never far, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. yea they, when pricked at heart, ſaw Chriſt preſently, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. and <hi>Peter</hi> applies the Promiſe to them, and reveals mercy to ſuch bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls. Chriſt and a lamenting ſoul are never far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Bee comforted, That this way of yours by Chriſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is the true way to Juſtification. Men cry up many new waies. 'Tis a great mercy in ſuch varieties of errors not to err: The truth of this way of Juſtification, is not onely true upon the truth of the word, but upon the truth of God himſelf: If God bee God, this juſtification muſt needs bee true. For here juſtice is ſatisfied, and ſo God pardons; which hee could as well un God himſelf as do, where his juſtice is not ſatisfied. So that wee may teſtify to you, 1 Pet. 5.12. <hi>That this is the true grace of God in which you ſtand.</hi> Men have a conceited grace different from this, but here you may ſafely ſet
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:168555:30"/>up, your reſting place, for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 5. Remember to maintain perpetual homage, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Jeſus Chriſt. Never forget ſo great a mercy. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> cries, Pſal. 116.6. <hi>O Lord I am thy ſervant, and the Son of thy hand-maid; thou haſt broken my bonds.</hi> The way of Servants, and Slaves ingaging themſelves to their Lords was, they yeelded their ſubmiſſion with promiſe and oath, to be Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to them as their Lords; and holding their hands between the hands of their Lords, they ſaid, I become your Servant from this day forth, for life, for limbs, for worldly honors: and ſhall owe you my fidelity, as long as I live. Well might this holy man ſay, <hi>I am thy Servant,</hi> ſince God had not brought him into, but broken his bonds. <hi>Paul</hi> argues much this way, 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. <hi>And hee dyed for all, that they that live, ſhould not live unto themſelves.</hi> Which falls foul upon that ignoble conceit; That if Chriſt gives ſatisfaction, wee are freed from all obedience to the Commandements. By which this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Chriſts ſatisfaction is made the occaſion of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and Chriſt is become the Miniſter of ſin, which <hi>Paul</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.17. 'Tis true, that ſince Chriſt hath paid the price of our redemption, there is nothing for us to do by way of ſatisfaction: but as much as in us lies, in obedience to the will of Chriſt, both from the nature of righteouſneſs and holineſs which are worth our exerciſing, and from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſideration of Chriſts yeelding obedience to every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and out of a ſtudy for conformity to the ſtate of glory hereafter. Yea, there is a Cauſal connexion (ſuch as is between the cauſe and effect) between Chriſts ſatisfaction applyed to us, and our holineſs. For Union with Chriſt by Faith, produceth this fruit neceſſarily, 1 Joh. 3.6. <hi>Hee that abides in him ſins not.</hi> The Spirit of Chriſt works it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. and true faith purifies the heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. So then let every man do the works of God without him, or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the work of God within him: Leſt <hi>fancy</hi> that works fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, rather than faith that works purification, bee found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. For hee that is bought with a price, will glorify God in ſoul and body, which are Chriſts by Redemption.</p>

            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:168555:31"/>
            <p>Chriſt not only ſuffered bodily death, but alſo the pains of the ſecond <hi>death,</hi> Iſa. 53.12. <hi>Hee poured out his ſoul unto death,</hi> yea, unto <hi>deaths,</hi> (for the Original word is in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) to ſhew that it ſtands in two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 In the abſence, and withdrawing of God from the ſoul, and the hiding the light of Gods countenance from it, leaving it to blackneſs of darkneſs. It was <hi>Sauls</hi> ſad complaint, <hi>That God was departed from him,</hi> 1 Sam. 28.15. So was it Chriſts miſery, when hee cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee,</hi> Matth. 27.46. which departure of God, anſwers the <hi>pain of loſs,</hi> that the Elect ſhould have ſuffered; yet know, that Chriſt was left but for a time, and that in regard of ſenſe, and feeling of comfort only; and no farther.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The fierce Indignation, and wrath of God, ſeized upon him, ſetting open the flood-gates of his anger, to overwhelm him with an unſufferable torture, of which when <hi>Heman</hi> had but a ſmall drop, to that full Cup which Chriſt drunk, hee complains, Pſal. 88.16. <hi>Thy fierce wrath goeth over mee, and thy terrours have cut mee off.</hi> At the taſte of which <hi>Job,</hi> Job 6.4. cries, <hi>The Arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poyſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of drinketh up my spirits: the terrors of God ſet themſelves in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray againſt mee.</hi> And this ſuffering of Chriſt anſwereth to that <hi>puniſhment of ſenſe</hi> the Elect ſhould indure.</p>

               <hi>Hee began to bee ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and to bee very heavy:</hi> or wee may more fully expreſs it thus, Hee begun to be gaſtred with wonderful aſtoniſhment, and to bee ſatiated, filled brimfull with heavineſs. A very
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:168555:32"/>ſad condition, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.38. hee ſaid, my ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death. It is beleagured, or compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed round with ſorrow; for ſo ſounds <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. All the ſins of the Elect, like a huge Army, meeting upon him, made a dreadful on-ſet on his ſoul. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43, 44. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>Hee was in an Agony.</hi> That's a conflict, in which a poor Creature wraſtles, with deadly pangs, with all his might; muſtring up all his faculties, and force, to grapple with them, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them: Thus did Chriſt ſtruggle with the indignation of the Lord; praying once and again, with more intenſe fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, <hi>Oh that the Cup may paſs away, if it bee poſſible!</hi> while yet an Angel, ſtrengthened his outward man, from ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinking in the conflict. Now if this weight that Chriſt bare, had been laid on the ſhoulders of all the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it would have ſunk them down to the loweſt hell. It would have crackt the Axel-tree of Heaven and Earth. It made his blood ſtartle out of his body, in congealed clodder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heaps. The heat of Gods fiery indignation, made his blood to boil up, till it ran over; yea, affrightened it out of its wonted chanel. The Creation coſt him but a words ſpeaking, and it was done; but it coſts <hi>bloody ſweats, ſoul-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,</hi> to go through the work of redemption.</p>
            <p n="2">2 His Agony on the Croſs, where hee drinks down the very Gall, and dregs of the Cup, that hee but ſipped of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. You hear him groaning out, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.46. with a loud voice, <hi>Eli, Eli, Lamaſabachthani.</hi> Which is not (as Papiſts ſay) a leaving of Chriſt in the hand of the Jews; for the miſery of death of the Saints, of the meaneſt rank, doth not argue, that God hath forſaken them, 2 Cor. 4.9. <hi>Wee are perſecuted, but not forſaken.</hi> Nor may we think, the God-head ever had left the man-hood, or that our Saviour had forſook his Father, for hee called him ſtill, My God, my God: but the forſaking was, the Fathers with-drawing the light of his countenance, and then what could follow but darkneſs and extream horror. The words are taken from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. where the bleſſed God is ſpoken to, as quite and clean gone out of the hearing of his crying, and roaring. Now that muſt needs bee much more than forſaking, that made the Son of God to <hi>roar,</hi> even the fierce wrath of the Almighty. So
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:168555:32"/>that, as the Greek Church prayed (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) It was unknown torment that our Saviour underwent. Hee encountred both the fathers wrath, kindled by the ſins of all the Elect; and entered the liſts with Satan, and all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darkneſs. Luke 22.23. <hi>This is your hour, and the power of darkneſs.</hi> All the Devils in Hell were up in Armes, and iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out of their gates, Principalities and Powers are all let looſe againſt the Redeemer of the World. This is ſome part of the ſecond death of Chriſt; but to clear it further, wee will anſwer a few objections.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>How could Chriſt ſuffer the pains of the ſecond death, without diſ-union of the God-head from the man-hood? for the God-head could not dye?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.16. <hi>God laid down his life for us.</hi> The perſon dying was God, elſe his perſon could have done us no good. The perſon ſuffering muſt bee God as well as man, but the God-head ſuffered not: As if you ſhoot off a Cannon in the bright Ayr, the air ſuffers, but the light of it ſuffers not. <hi>Actions and Paſſions belong to Perſons.</hi> Nothing leſs than that Perſon who is God man, could bear the brunt of the day, and overcome for our juſtification.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>How could Chriſt indure Hell fire without grievous ſins, as blaſphemy and despair?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The perturbations of Chriſt, were like the ſhakings of pure water, in a clean glaſs; the water remains pure ſtill. When Chriſt was ſhaken, there was no mudd in the bottome, which riſes in us, when wee ſuffer extremity. And again, as the body of Chriſt dyed without dividing the God-head from it; So his ſoul dyed the ſecond death, without parting of the God-head from it. Beſides, Blaſphemy and Deſpair, are no parts of the pains of the damned, but the conſequents, and follow the ſenſe of Gods wrath, in a ſinful creature, that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.9. But Chriſt had no ſin of his own, nor was overcome of wrath, and therefore held faſt his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But when did Chriſt ſuffer hell torments? they are inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after death, not before it uſually: but Chriſts ſoul went ſtrait af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death into Paradiſe, how elſe could hee ſay? This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:168555:33"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1 'Tis not impoſſible that the pains of the ſecond death, ſhould bee ſuffered in this life. Time and place are but circumſtances; the main ſubſtance of the ſecond death, is the bearing Gods fierce wrath. The favour of God in Hell to a man, would make Hell a Heaven. The place is not a part of the debt neither, and therefore ought to bee no part of the payment. The laying down of the Price makes the ſatisfaction. This is all that is ſpoken and threatned to <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 2.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> and this may bee ſuffered here. Wicked go to Hell <hi>as their Priſon,</hi> becauſe they can never pay their debts; otherwiſe the debt may as well bee paid in the market, as the Gaol. This Chriſt <hi>did in the dayes of his fleſh, when hee offered up ſtrong crys, and tears,</hi> Heb. 5.7. not after death.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But the pains due to mans ſins are to bee everlasting? how can Chriſts ſhort ſufferings countervail them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> If the <hi>meaſure</hi> of a mans puniſhment were <hi>Infinite,</hi> the <hi>duration</hi> needs not be <hi>infinite.</hi> Sinful mans meaſure of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is finite, and therefore the duration of his puniſhment muſt bee infinite, becauſe the puniſhment muſt bee anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the infinite evil of ſin, committed againſt an infinite God. But Chriſt God-man, ſuffered puniſhment in <hi>meaſure infinite,</hi> and therefore there is no ground why hee ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it eternally. Add moreover, that the dignity of Chriſts perſons, did excuſe him from puniſhment infinite for duration, for Act. 2.24. <hi>It was impoſſible that hee ſhould bee holden of death,</hi> becauſe hee was both the Father of Life, and the Lords Holy One.</p>
            <p>Beſides, continual impriſonment in Hell, ariſes from mans not being able to pay the price; for could hee pay the debt in one year, hee needs not lye two years in Priſon. Now the debt is the firſt and ſecond death; becauſe therefore ſinful man cannot pay it in any time, he muſt endure it eternally. But Chriſt is ready pay, hee laies it down upon the nail, to the full, for all Chriſts Elect: therefore it is not required of him, that hee ſhould ſuffer for ever. Neither can it ſtand with Gods Juſtice to hold him under the ſecond death, having paid the debt.</p>
            <p>Now that hee hath paid, he witneſſeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.30. ſaying,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:168555:33"/>when hee had received the Vinegar, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> So verſ. 28. <hi>After this Jeſus knowing that all things were accompliſhed.</hi> Many Interpretations are given of the place, but this alone will hold water; That the heavy wrath of the Lord, which did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue Chriſt, and the ſecond death, that filled him with griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous terrors, is now <hi>over</hi> and paſt. It cannot bee conſtrued, of the fulfilling all <hi>Types</hi> and figures, for many Types, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies did pre-figure his death; as that, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah muſt bee cut off; and all the Sacrifices muſt dye; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of his Reſurrection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. the prophecy of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, and ſitting at Gods right hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. <hi>Iſa.</hi>

            <p n="1">1 That ſin hath no ſuch great evil in it as is imagined; and therefore they make a mock of ſin; blaſpheming them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3, 4. that run not to the ſame exceſs of riot with them. Let ſuch know, that beſides the judgements recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againſt ſin, and the tumbling of Angels down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, reſerving them in chains under darkneſs: beſides the caſting <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe for ſin: and the drowning the old World; the fire and brimſtone of <hi>Sodom;</hi> the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the torments of the damned in Hell-fire, where the worm dyeth not, and the fire goeth not out, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44, 46, 48. That which is ten thouſand times more terrible, take thou notice of, that Chriſt ſuffers an <hi>agony</hi> for mans ſin; behold, <hi>God</hi> dying for the ſins of the Elect. See his miſery, who is but a ſurety, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. Sins of men, <hi>crucify the Lord of Glory:</hi> and put him to ſo painful, ſo ſhameful a death as thou haſt heard. God over all, bleſſed for ever, is <hi>curſed</hi> in but bearing thy ſins. If God ſo puniſhed the ſurety, how will he deal with the principal? Canſt thou hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O impenitent Soul! to ſpeed better in thy own ſins, than Chriſt could, that bare but the ſins of others? 1 Sam. 14.39. <hi>As the Lord liveth who ſaveth</hi> Iſrael, <hi>though it bee in</hi> Jonathan <hi>my Son, hee ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye;</hi> ſaid <hi>Saul.</hi> If the Son muſt dye, what will become of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168555:34"/>the Servant? what will become of the Slave? Laugh on, but know that Chriſt wept for ſin: rejoyce thou, but withall remember that Chriſts ſoul was heavy to the death about it. And it may bee, thou wilt one day, hear God laughing at thy miſery, as thou doſt at thy ſin, Prov. 1.26. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Babylon,</hi> Rev. 18.7. <hi>So much as ſhee hath glorified her ſelf, ſo much ſorrow and torment give her.</hi> Chriſt ſmarted for the ſins of the Elect: and thou muſt one day expect to feel, as much torment for ſin, as thou haſt taken pleaſure in committing of it. The ſport and pleaſure of ſin, is like that play, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.14. where they deſtroyed each other. Young men in merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and jollity, make a mirthful paſtime of Drunkenneſs and riotting: till their ſports prove the bloody murtherers of each other. Man nor Angel durſt not call Chriſt accurſed, if the Holy Ghoſt had not ſaid it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. and ſurely then, O vain man, thy condition muſt needs bee exceeding curſed, if Chriſt were accurſed, for ſin imputed only. Oh the gall of bitterneſs! that ſin will bring wretched men into. <hi>Knowest thou not that it will bee bitterneſs in the latter end?</hi> 2 Sam. 2.26.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Conceiveſt thou,
<note n="2" place="margin">Conceit.</note> that God is merciful, and therefore thou ſhalt do well enough, though thou doſt continue in ſin. Know, that <hi>God spared not his only Son,</hi> Rom. 8.32. and why ſhould hee ſpare thee his very enemy? would hee not ſpare a Son? and an onely Son? and will hee ſpare a ſtranger? an enemy? Shall a Son of <hi>Belial</hi> ſpeed better than the Son of God? Did Chriſts neerneſs of relation abate him nothing? and ſhalt thou bee abated? hopeſt thou to finde more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at Gods hands, than Chriſt could? Luke 23.31. <hi>If this bee done in the green tree, what will hee do in the dry?</hi> Chriſt was not ſuch dry fuel, for his Fathers wrath to burn up, as thou art.

Chriſt is ſtronger than all Men and Angels, that created the Heavens, and bears up its Pillars, that they ſtagger not, yet blood leaps out of his veins, when hee comes to encounter his Fathers wrath. Hee cries with tears, Father, if it be poſſible, Let this Cup paſs from mee. And again, hee groans it out. Pſal. 90.11. <hi>Who knows the power of his Anger?</hi> that made his Son thus to cry out? The earth trembled at it. The Sun mourned under an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe at the ſight of it. The graves opened to ſigh at his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The rocks cleft in ſunder.

The Law ſhews ſin a ſword to draw our blood; but this ſhews it to be a Spear drawing the heart blood of the Son of God. The Law makes man accurſed, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel makes the Son of God accurſed. The ſin of all the world on one man, could not bring him ſo low, as the leaſt ſin of the Elect, can bring the Son of God. <hi>Adams</hi> ſin threw him out of Paradiſe, from earth to earth, and his Sons into hell, that is, but from earth to hell: but Chriſt is by imputed ſin, fallen from the glory of heaven, to the very ſorrows of hell. Whither then will the ſinner fly for ſuccour? Do not think, O impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent man, that thou canſt better thy ſelf, by flying from the Law to the Goſpel.

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. This informs, that no puniſhment (properly ſo called) belongs to the Members of Chriſt, nor are any of their <hi>Afflictions</hi> to bee deemed puniſhments for ſin. For if Chriſt hath ſuffered to the full, <hi>All the puniſhment</hi> due to his Members; then there is no puniſhment left to them to ſuffer: but Chriſt hath ſuffered to the utmoſt, whatſoever puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was due to his Members, for their ſin; therefore there is none remaining to be ſuffered by them. The Propoſition is thus proved: If any of the Members of Chriſt, ſhould bee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for their ſins, then God the Father ſhould inflict a double puniſhment for the ſame ſins; but it cannot ſtand with the Juſtice of God, to puniſh the ſame ſins twice. So
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:168555:36"/>that the bittereſt afflictions Gods children ſuffer in this life, are of a farre differing nature from puniſhments.
<note place="margin">Simile.</note> For as the Sea-waters, though they are in themſelves ſalt, brackiſh, and briniſh, and very fretful; yet running through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny veins, turnings, and windings in the earth, loſe their ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and only retain refreſhing, cooling, and clenſing ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and moyſture in them: ſo the afflictions falling on Gods children, in themſelves ſharp and briniſh, yet running through the Merits, and Bowels of the Lord Jeſus; <hi>only</hi> retain a cleanſing, cooling, and refreſhing nature in them.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But Gods children ſuffer as many, and the ſame mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial evils with other men; as poverty, ſickneſſe, loſſes, croſſes, and death it ſelf,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.1. There is one event to all; <hi>yea the godly have oft the worst of it,</hi> Pſal. 73.14. All the day long have I been plagued, and chaſtened every morning: <hi>while the wicked, verſ.</hi> 5. Are not in trouble like other men. <hi>How then doth it appear, that Chriſt hath ſuffered all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the elect?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol</hi> A carnal eye indeed ſeeth things in this eſtate, but a righteous judgement ſees them farre otherwiſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> could ſee the Buſh all on fire, and yet not conſumed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Daniels</hi> companions met with a fiery Furnace, whoſe flame burned not thoſe that were in it; but thoſe that ſtood by, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.22, 25. Theſe were ſeemingly ſcorching fiery flames, but were not ſo in reality. But you will ſay, wherein is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference?</p>
            <p n="1">1 In regard of the <hi>Principle</hi> from whence they come,
<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of godly and the wicked</note> they much differ. The judgements laid on the wicked come from an angry Judge: the afflictions of the godly from a loving Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God puniſheth the wicked, as part of their payment, in indignation and wrath, whence they are called <hi>children of wrath,</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. <hi>And when he is about to fill his belly, God ſhall caſt the fury of his wrath upon him, and ſhall rain on him while he is eating,</hi> Job 20.23. All comes to the wicked from a Sin-revenging God: but to the godly from a careful Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. <hi>Whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> So God ſpeaks of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 89.30-34. <hi>If his children forſake my Laws, and walk not in my judgements; I will viſit their offences. Nevertheleſſe my
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:168555:36"/>loving kindneſſe will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſſe to fail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 They differ in their <hi>nature.</hi> They have not the venome, nor poyſon in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56. that <hi>Achitophels</hi> had; who being but rejected once in his counſel, had ſo much ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of ſin in that ſmall affliction, that hee hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In their ſuitableneſſe. Miſeries are called <hi>the Lords cup.</hi> An expreſſion borrowed from Phyſitians, that have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Doſes of Potions, according to the ſeveral Diſeaſes. Now the wicked hath a cup fit for him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Upon the wicked hee ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt, this ſhall be the portion of their cup.</hi> Where could a man ſtep, when it rained fire and brimſtone in <hi>Sodome?</hi> This is a killing cup. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.8. <hi>A cup full of mixture in the hand of the Lord, whoſe dreggs the wicked of the earth ſhall drink.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.28. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.7. The godly have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cup fit for them: (who alſo have need of Phyſick) and this cup ſometimes is very bitter. <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.11. <hi>Shall I not drink of the cup that the Father hath given me?</hi> When a Father gives his dear child a potion, how exact will he bee? rather under than over, in the quantities of the ingredients. Chriſt hath drunk already the poyſonous Cup, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe from me.</hi> None remains but the purging cup. And Gods <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> requires, that this cup bee tempered, according to our ſtrength and ability, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</p>
            <p n="4">4 They differ in their <hi>end.</hi> Jam. 5.11. <hi>You have heard of the patience of</hi> Job, <hi>and yee have ſeen the end of the Lord.</hi> What end? That the Lord is very pittiful, and of tender mercy. So did <hi>Abraham, Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> find an happy iſſue of all their ſorrows, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16. <hi>To doe thee good in the latter end. David</hi> ſaid, it was <hi>good for him,</hi> Pſal. 119. And calls the man <hi>bleſſed who endureth correction, whom God chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and teacheth,</hi> Pſal. 94.12. and it is ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Some of them of underſtanding ſhall fall to try them, and to purge them, and make them white.</hi> Now the calamities of wicked men doe haſten, and heighten their everlaſting deſtruction; and are at beſt, but the beginnings of ſorrows, and furtherers of their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:168555:37"/>ſins: by making their hearts hard, and their eyes blind. As it fared with King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. <hi>This is that King</hi> Ahaz, <hi>that in the time of his diſtreſſe, treſpaſſed yet more againſt the Lord.</hi> This alſo was the event of <hi>Jerobeams</hi> calamities, for 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.4, 33. after his hand was withered, and again recovered, he returned not from his evil ways. Look what good the flames of Hell doe the damned, as much and no more doe afflictions for the wicked; <hi>they curſe God, and blaſpheme more and more.</hi> God therefore ſtabs the wicked, as an enemy, with his Sword: but lances the godly, as a Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Patient, with the Launcet. Thus <hi>chaſtiſements</hi> befall the godly, but <hi>puniſhments</hi> the wicked.</p>

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Of ſtrong Conſolation to all the children of God, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuffered all that puniſhment,</hi>

               <hi>that their poor ſouls might have bewailed here, and muſt have done, for ever hereafter.</hi> Chriſt hath drunk off that cup of trembling to the bottom, he hath left no Curſe, no Death eternal, no Hell for you to ſuffer, your condition can never be lower, than it is in <hi>this</hi> world. God bids the Miniſters take care to comfort you, O Elect and precious. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.1, 2. <hi>Comfort yee, comfort yee my people, &amp;c.</hi> they are commiſſioned from Heaven to ſpeak to your very hearts; telling you, your iniquities are forgiven. Why? becauſe you have received in your head mony e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to pay your debts to the utmoſt. As God hath given us in charge to comfort you, ſo hath he given you charge to receive comfort. Let then the verieſt babe in Chriſt, come and refreſh himſelf with theſe breaſts; ſuck at this Nipple; whereſoever is the leaſt ſpark of true grace, let that ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; becauſe Chriſt ſuffered, all this perplexity and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, that you might never ſuffer it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Hee dyed to deliver thoſe that through fear of death, &amp;c.</hi> he dyed to ſave you from ſlaviſh fear. He wept, that you might bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. He dyed, that you might never dye eternally. Hee was curſed, that you might be bleſſed. Hee was full of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that you might always rejoyce, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. Hee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, that we might be excuſed: and condemned, that wee might bee acquitted: Hee endured the fierceneſſe of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wrath and indignation, that we might never know what belongs to it.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:168555:37"/>
            <p n="1">1 Be comforted then in the ſharpeſt brunt of diſtreſſe,
<note place="margin">Thou ſhalt be pittied in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through terror of heart within, or trouble without; for the Lord will pitty thee in thy worſt eſtate, for Chriſts ſake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. <hi>As a father pittieth his children, ſo the Lord pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth all, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt conſider in thine heart, that as a man chasteneth his Son, ſo the Lord thy God chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee.</hi> And though Chriſt bee in Heaven, yet his bowels and compaſſions do yern toward thee. For <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Wee have not an High Prieſt, that cannot be moved, with the feeling of our infirmities, but he was, in all points, tempted, &amp;c.</hi> Ah how ſweet is it to conſider, that our High Prieſt is no ſtranger, to ſoul-troubles, or to body-diſquietments; but being temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as wee are, hath a ſympathie, and fellow-feeling with us. All our croſſes and trials reach to him, as well as us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9. <hi>He is afflicted in our afflictions.</hi> Hee eſcapes not when wee are perſecuted. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17, 18. Hee was made like unto us on purpoſe, that he might be ſenſible of our calamities. It is a lamentable condition a poor ſoul is in, when it hath none to pitty, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12. It is their ſad complaint, that all paſt by, and minded not the Church. Shee looks for commiſeration and finds none, that is a doleful eſtate. But here is our rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, that we have a tender-hearted Saviour, both able, and willing to ſuccour his poor ſervants. And no wonder that he is ſo willing; for who would purchaſe at ſo dear a rate, and not uphold? Who would beat ſo much coſt, and at laſt loſe all for a trifle? Hath Chriſt (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Galathians,</hi> 3.4, 5.) ſuffered ſo many things in vain? Surely, as poor Creatures are not willing to loſe their coſt and pains; ſo Chriſt will not loſe the travail of his ſoul; his bitter Death, and bloudy Sufferings, for nought. It is the greateſt abſurdity in Chriſtian Religion to ſuppoſe it. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>ult. If righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe be by the Law, Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> But Chriſts death is in vain, and his grace is in vain, if it may not comfort a poor ſoul in diſtreſſe. Turn therefore to thy Beloved in thy diſtreſſe, and ask him, whether hee hath not been in the ſtate of humiliation, a man of ſorrows, and one that drunk deep of the gall and wormwood of Gods indignation; that hath felt the wrath of an angry Judge, and knows what it is to be in a forlorn ſtate; and hath paid dear to undergoe the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:168555:38"/>of our peace: And can hee forget his poor Members in their ſorrows, and have no compaſſion? Can hee forget his anoynting? how he was appointed of the Father, to bind up the broken-hearted, to impart the oyl of gladneſſe to his fellows? Hath he ſpent ſo much bloud in vain? try, thus, if he can turn his back, and leave thee comfort leſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Thou ſhalt alſo be freed from thy ſorrows in due ſeaſon.
<note place="margin">Thou ſhalt bee freed from ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</note> God will not only give thee fair words, but thou ſhalt have real help, and deliverance.

But who taught the Stork, the Turtle, and the Crane, in the Heavens, to know their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time? <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7. Was it not the Lord our Creator? and ſhall not he that taught them, know himſelf? Shall he not relieve you in your ſeaſons? Now, what is it that gauls? if we may lay our hands upon the ſore, and touch it, it is ſin that pricks, that diſquiets: but you know, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18-24. <hi>Yee are not come to the mount, that might not be touch'd, that burned with fire, nor unto blackneſſe, and darkneſſe, and tempeſts, &amp;c. but to Jeſus the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and to the bloud of ſprinkling, &amp;c. whoſe bloud ſpeaks better things than that of</hi> Abel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.9.10. which cried loud for vengeance. All ſins ſpeak, but his cried <hi>aloud</hi> for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: but Chriſts bloud muſt needs cry louder for mercy. For the ſhedding of Chriſts bloud was a greater ſin, than the ſhedding of <hi>Abels;</hi> for the <hi>Jews</hi> ſin in Crucifying Chriſt, was greater than <hi>Cains</hi> in killing his brother, yet Chriſts bloud prevailed to ſave them, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36.

               <note place="margin">Beleevers may be deferted, but not utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken.</note> Chriſts deſertion hath ſo qualified all thy deſertions, that thou ſhalt not utterly and finally forſake God: nor hee utterly, much leſſe finally forſake thee. <hi>Joh.</hi> 119.30. none of Gods children are ſecured, from being forſaken by him: <hi>Job</hi> was, <hi>David</hi> was, and <hi>Aſa</hi> was, and not without need; For,</p>

            <p n="3">3 Sometimes Gods people cleave to the Creature, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him; and then no wonder if hee forſakes them. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. ult. <hi>They compaſs themſelves about with ſparks, and ſhall therefore lye down in ſorrow.</hi>

            <p n="4">4 They muſt in ſome meaſure bee conformable unto Chriſt, that they may the better judge, what Chriſt hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for them. But none of Gods children are ſo forſaken as Chriſt was: for Chriſt was forſaken in a way of revenge, by God as a juſt Judge; but ours comes from another Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Again, Chriſt drunk the Cup of Gods wrath to the bottome; wee do but ſip, and taſte of the Cup, ſweetened through Chriſt.

            <p n="3">3 The Lord intends by it, to make Chriſtians ranſack

It will make him to regard a gracious man, as <hi>one of thouſand.</hi> It will make him Catechiſe himſelf, whether hee hath any evidence of Gods love; or whether hee lives not in ſome ſin or other; or whether hee bee willing to part with all for Chriſt; or whether hee maintains any Communion with God; which are quickning queſtions.</p>
            <p>Now then if any man be under this calamity to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf forſaken of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Let him conſider, That the extream ſufferings of Chriſt, were to reconcile God and man, to bring God back again to man, and man to his God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19. which hee muſt wait for.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Let him not paſs the ſentence of reprobation upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; or ſay hee is an Hypocrite, becauſe for the preſent he is under trouble of Spirit. It had been a dreadful Concluſion, for Chriſt to have queſtioned, whether hee was the Son of God, becauſe of his deſertion. Say rather, <hi>wee may have the preſence of his Grace and Spirit, when wee want the preſence of his comfort.</hi> As a man in a ſwoon may have a living ſoul, though hee wants the operation of it; and a man may injoy ſome light of the Sun, in the firmament, though the Sun be eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: So may a Saint have life, and direction from God, when hee finds not its comfortable actings.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Let him take Chriſts courſe, to ſet faith and praiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. When Chriſt was in his agony, he prayed the more earneſtly, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.41. and uſed his faith eminently; crying, <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 12.27. <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled;</hi> here is your caſe: <hi>Father ſave mee from this hour:</hi> here is your duty: of faith, crying [Father] of prayer [ſave mee from this hour.]</p>
            <p n="4">4 Plead for the Fruit of Chriſts deſertion; which was, that thou maieſt not bee utterly forſaken, ply him hard, and thou wilt find him nighter thee, than thou waſt aware of.</p>
            <p n="3">3 And be upheld in death it ſelf;
<note place="margin">Thou ſhalt bee upheld in death it ſelf.</note> for Chriſt hath triumphed over death, Hell and the Devil, in the croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. And not only triumphed over them as overcome; but hath taken
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:168555:39"/>great ſpoiles, even all their armour: deaths ſting is plucked out, the bonds of the Grave are broken, Death is van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by Chriſts death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. which reſolves <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> knotty riddle, Judg. 14.14. <hi>Out of the eater commeth forth meat, and out of the ſtrong comes ſweetneſs. Paul</hi> keeps the thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving day, for that happy victory, 1 Cor. 15.57. <hi>Thanks bee to God, &amp;c.</hi> For the whole Conqueſt is perfected, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. and that for ever: And the Teſtament is for ever confirmed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.17. by the death of the Teſtator. Nothing is wanting to carry us happily to glory, through death it ſelf. There needs no more ſacrifices, nor no ſecond offering for ſin; All is finiſhed.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>This is good news, but how ſhall I know that I have a right to this comfort?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its a weighty Queſtion, and needs a ſolid reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which wee ſhall hereafter more fully give. At preſent, take that rule, Heb. 10.14. <hi>Hee hath perfected for ever, them that are ſanctified.</hi> So Heb. 5.9. <hi>Hee became the Author of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto them that obey him.</hi> No Prophane, no nor unſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified man (however civilized) hath any part or portion in this conſolation.</p>
            <p>Such therefore as think there cannot bee a Saint on Earth, or think it too ſoon to be holy, or make a mock at a preciſe Goſpel-Converſation, may in no wiſe apply this comfort to themſelves. It is not enough to bee Church-members, or viſible Saints; but wee muſt bee ſanctified in truth and reallity. Chriſt ſhould loſe a great part of the effects of his ſufferings, if wee ſhould not bee ſanctified. Eph. 5.25, 26. <hi>Christ gave himſelf for his Church, that hee might ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify it, and cleanſe it: and can any man think hee will loſe his end? and miſs his main intent?</hi> ſurely no. There is none but the Church myſtical (who are truely ſanctified, and cleanſed) that have any fellowſhip in this buſineſſe. Let the upright in heart therefore take this Conſolation, as a diſh prepared for none other, but their refreſhing, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 32. <hi>ult. Deut.</hi> 33.1.</p>

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Of Refutation of that ignorant diſcourſe of foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh People, who affirm, <hi>That the leaſt drop of Chriſts blood
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:168555:40"/>is ſufficient to ſave the world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The leaſt drop of Chriſts blood will not ſave.</note> Why ſay they ſo? becauſe of the dignity of the perſon of Chriſt. If this were true, then the Circumciſion of Chriſt was enough, for there was a drop of blood ſhed: or his Crown of thornes was enough, for (tis like) they drew blood. Then all Chriſts ſufferings beſides were ſuperfluous, and vain. Then God were unjuſt to take more than was his due. Then Chriſt was fooliſh and imprudent, to pay more than hee needed. But Chriſt himſelf ſaies, theſe many things were neceſſary, Mark. 8.3. <hi>The Son of man muſt ſuffer many things.</hi> Luk. 24.26. <hi>Ought not Chriſt to ſuffer theſe things, and to enter into his Glory?</hi> There was a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of ſuffering; and of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things. There was a neceſſity in reſpect of the <hi>end,</hi> that the Elect might have the bleſſing: and therefore Chriſt is made a Curſe, that hee might bear the Curſe due to their ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</p>

<note place="margin">The refuge of greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> And firſt to the <hi>vileſt ſinners.</hi> For this Doctrin darts forth a little light, to thoſe poor ſouls, in the dark dungeon of their natural, yea, moſt ſinful eſtate. It ſhews a poſſibility of eſcape from the wrath to come. 'Tis true, none but a ſanctified man can have any comfort in Chriſts death, or conclude his ſalvation by the death and ſufferings of Chriſt: Yet there is hope of ſalvation a <hi>far off,</hi> Pſal. 89.19. <hi>There is help laid upon one that is mighty.</hi> Col. 1.19. <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him all fulneſs dwells.</hi> Eph. 2.13. <hi>You that were a far off.</hi> Pſal. 119.155. <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is far from the wicked, becauſe they ſeek not thy Statutes.</hi> There is corn in <hi>Egypt,</hi> it is beſt for the vile ſinner to go thither.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:168555:41"/>Though ſalvation bee ſo nigh, tis not ſafe to ſtand ſtill. Wee may ſafely preach this doctrin, for the Text gives Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and preſs it, for the Text will bear it. 'Tis ſaid, ver. 23, 24. <hi>All have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, &amp;c.</hi> This infers not, that All the ſinners in the world, are thus freely juſtified. This would infer <hi>univerſal juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> but that is not here intended: The meaning is, That all ſinners, whether Jews or Gentiles, are in themſelves, excluded from eternal life: and all that are juſtified, are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by free grace. So that, though thou knoweſt thy ſelf to be a vile ſinner, yet ſome ſinners, (you may ſee) are juſtified. In truth, none are juſtified but ſinners, and therefore thou mayeſt ſee thy ſelf capable of juſtification: of the ſame juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication that the beſt Saints ever partook of. Chriſt was ſent into the World, on purpoſe to pay the Ranſome for Sinners: and the revealing, and offering this truth, was to ſave thee, whatſoever thou art, that heareſt it. Joh. 3.17. <hi>God ſent not his Son into the World, to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How then comes any to be damned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hee Anſwers: None is condemned, but they that love darkneſs rather than light. Now ſuch exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the benefit of Chriſts ſufferings, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. Doth thy conſcience therefore bear witneſs to thy guilt? Love not thy ſin inſeparably, and thy ſalvation is probable.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>True, if I were a ſinner as other men, and women, there is encouragement enough to look out: but my ſins exceed for number, weight, and meaſure, and therefore my Condition is yet mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou canſt not name any ſin in the World, but final impenitency, but have many examples of their pardon; and the ſalvation of ſome that committed them, in the word of God. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Blaſphemer, a Perſecutor, and yet found mercy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13-17. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> pardoned his murther, witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, Idolatry, and doing worſe than the <hi>Amorites,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21.1.—12. yea, the very murther of the Son of God was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37, 38. And what ſin can bee greater? Yea, pardon is promiſed beyond the very thought, and hope of man, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7, 8. Rebellion againſt God cannot exclude
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168555:41"/>from pardon, Pſal. 68.18. <hi>Hee received gifts for the rebellious, that the Lord may dwell among them.</hi> God indeed gives a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to take heed, that there bee no root <hi>among you that beareth gaul and wormwood, to bleſs himſelf in ſin,</hi> Deut. 29.19, 20. It will coſt that ſoul dear, that harbours ſuch thoughts againſt God.</p>
            <p>There is no mercy in Scripture, nor in Heaven neither, for ſuch a ſoul as this is, Hee muſt have another word that will maintain this hope, the Scripture will not bear it. <hi>God will not bee merciful to any ſuch, as go on in their ſinful courſes.</hi> Pſal. 68.21. But for the ſinner, that is weary of his ſins, Rom. 5.17. <hi>There is abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs in Chriſt. Luther</hi> was a man much terrified with his ſin, yet hee confeſſed, this was the balſome of his ſoul, Rom. 11.32. <hi>God hath ſhut up all under ſin, that hee might have mercy upon all.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let none ſuch deſpair of Salvation, that are in the priſon of ſin. Yea, wee may adde a word more, but let not the Swine turn about and rend it: <hi>That the more vile thou haſt been in ſin, if thou beeſt the more vile in thine own eies, thou art more fit for Mercy, than a Civil man, that hath pleaſed himſelf in his own honeſty and civility.</hi> Matth. 21.31, 32. ſaies Chriſt, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, that Publicans and Harlots ſhall enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, before you.</hi> Chriſt was a door, by which Publicans and Harlots, exceeding vile ſinners, entered; and this door is open this day to poor ſinners; his ſufferings are offered, his blood, even the blood of God, is provided, and what are thy ſins to his blood? what then remains, but that thou ſhouldeſt haſten to thy ſanctuary, to that precious ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? that is paid for ſinners, Iſa. 8.14. <hi>Chriſt is a Phyſitian, the whole have no need of him,</hi> Matth. 9.12, 13. <hi>but the ſick.</hi> And there is no diſeaſe incurable to him: and indeed to look at thy diſeaſe as incurable, is to ſhame thy Phyſitian, and that will be a worſe ſin than all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How may a ſinner come to the benefit of this ſatisfaction of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Reſt not till thou haſt an inlightned,
<note place="margin">Get an awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned conſcience.</note> and an awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Conſcience. It is certain, a ſinner is put in Priſon, in <hi>hold</hi> (Rom. 11.32. <hi>God hath ſhut up,</hi> or put in hold) before hee hath deliverance by Chriſt. For the Conſcience is a lock, which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168555:42"/>muſt bee opened by Gods key, before this Gaol-delivery can bee perfected. Gal. 3.23. <hi>Before Faith come, wee were kept under the Law, ſhut up unto the Faith, which ſhould afterward bee reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> A light goes with the Word, draw not the curtain to keep it out.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Take heed,
<note place="margin">When God ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience break not away.</note> when God arreſts thy Conſcience, thou make not an eſcape; As ſome Malefactors, that when Law and Juſtice have taken hold of them, they creep out at ſome hole, or break Priſon. So ſome Sinners, when terrified in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, dawb with untempered Mortar, healing the hurt ſlightly, by ſpeaking a falſe peace to their own hearts: which was <hi>Herods</hi> Caſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.19. who being ſtoutly reproved by <hi>John Baptist,</hi> of his incontinence towards <hi>Herodias</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife, and many other ſins; Hee made his eſcape, by putting <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in Priſon. So did <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.5, 6. when the man of God reproved him, and the Altar rent, his hand was withered, and healed, his Conſcience was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened: but when the Prophet was ſlain by a Lyon, his Conſcience fell aſleep again. This was <hi>Judas</hi> overthrow, he was often terrified by Chriſt, but hee caſt himſelf into a dead ſleep again, by that opinion the Diſciples had concerning him, and ſo loſt all.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Let a ſinner obſerve diligently,
<note place="margin">Obſerve the working of Chriſts death on thy heart.</note> and yeeld to the working of the death of Chriſt upon his heart, when he comes to apply his death and ſatisfaction, to his ſoul. Let this bee minded with trembling, for there is a <hi>drawing</hi> power in Chriſts blood, that teacheth to ſinners, Joh. 12.32, 33. <hi>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men after mee. This he ſpeaks, ſignifying by what death hee ſhould dye.</hi> 1 Hee ſpeaks of his death, and lifting up from the earth: 2 Hee ſaith, then hee would draw all men unto him, and that muſt needs be meant of them that were out of Chriſt: and (the truth is) there was never any brought home to Chriſt, but it was by the vertue, and efficacy of his death <hi>drawing.</hi> Chriſt lifted up on the Croſs, hath purchaſed the Spirit, for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14. and that laies hold on poor ſinners to draw them. Again, Chriſt was lifted from the Croſs to Heaven, where hee intercedes, and applies his ſatisfaction, as it pleaſes him, giving gifts to men, for the gathering of ſinners to himſelf. Gifts given to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:168555:42"/>the Miniſtry to gather the rebellious. Be wiſe, and mind it.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhall a Sinner obſerve this, that hee may yeeld to it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. See and obſerve it in the Miniſtry.
<note place="margin">Directions to benefit by Gods drawings.</note> There are none that attend a faithful Miniſtry, but have many a pull from Chriſt. He lets down his Cords into the deep Dungeon, haling a ſoul to himſelf; ſometimes by convincing him of ſin, through his Law; commanding by his terror,
<note place="margin">Minde Gods drawings by the Miniſtry.</note> inticing by ſweet invitations, and ſweeter promiſes; ſo that the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath ſometimes thoughts, That all is nought with him, and he reſolves amendment. And ſometimes Chriſt hampers a ſoul, that he cannot get away, nor reſt, whither ſoever hee goes: Chriſt tuggs at him, and the man wonders at himſelf, why it is thus with him! O Sinners, take notice, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are but throwing Chriſts <hi>Caſting-net,</hi> and laying his <hi>Toyls.</hi> Take heed how you carry your ſelves; ſay not, with the Heathen, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let us break his bonds in ſunder, and caſt away his cords from us,</hi> for he that ſits in Heaven will take cognizance of it, and vexe you in his ſore diſpleaſure. Yeeld rather to Chriſt, to be drawn by him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Take heed of with-drawments, and pull-backs:
<note place="margin">Take heed of pull-backs.</note> thy heart within, and the world without; thy curſed counſels, and worldly ſnares will ſtave thee off, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> the Devil alſo will have a pluck at you; yea Chriſt never draws, but he pulls with all might and main. Now if you decline by theſe retractions, you give place to the Devil.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Think not to be drawn as ſtocks and ſtones,
<note place="margin">Think not to be drawn as ſtocks and ſtones.</note> but as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, that when they fall into a pit, labour to get out again: and make uſe of what help they can get from others; and <hi>further</hi> all that they have yet received. As thoſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. when the Lord ſaid, <hi>Turn yee back-ſliding chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they ſay, Behold we come unto thee, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>ult. It is good to draw near unto God;</hi> yea, the greateſt good in the world. Say therefore, now Chriſts death is bringing mee to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. It is the happineſſe of the Creature, to enjoy communion with God; and ſhall not I receive it, when it is offered? Since God works, let mee work out my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Juſtifie God in all thy bitterneſſe, that he exerciſeth thee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:168555:43"/>under,
<note place="margin">Juſtifie God in all thy bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> in bringing thee home to Chriſt. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God, &amp;c.</hi> and juſtifie his dealings with thee, when God approaches with his Word or Rod. God caſts down before he raiſes, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>I will bring them into the Wilderneſſe, and there will I ſpeak comfortably to them.</hi> Even to a wilderneſſe-condition doth he bring his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as he did <hi>Iſrael,</hi> amongſt fiery ſtinging Serpents, and appalling dangers. They muſt paſſe through the valley of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,</hi> that is, of conſternation, which is the door of hope. For man hath never a hopeful ſign on him, till he hath paſſed his perplexed eſtate. To every true Convert, God gives teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that truth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Thine own wickedneſſe ſhall correct thee, and thine own back-ſlidings ſhall reprove thee, that thou mayeſt know what an evil, and a bitter thing it is, to forſake the living God.</hi> And it is mercy that thy wickedneſs doth but correct, though with Scorpions: ſince it hath condemned others, and might have damned thee. It is well that he lays nothing more bitter and heavie, that hath a cup of trembling at his beck, and Hell before him. Nay, it is not enough neither, that thou ſhouldeſt ſubmit, when thou art humbled of God: for thou oughteſt to humble thy ſelf under Gods hand (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) elſe the Devils are as humble as thou art. He that fights, and flings, to ſhake off the yoke, is a fighter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; hee rather juſtles with him, than juſtifies him. Say with <hi>Ephraim, Turn me, and I ſhall be turned,</hi> Jerem. 31.18, 19. <hi>For after I was turned, I repented; after I was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, I ſmote upon my thigh: I was aſhamed, and even confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi> When God humbled <hi>Ephraim,</hi> he humbled himſelf; He was active in his humiliation as well as paſſive; God threw him low, and he threw himſelf lower. Then God ſaies, <hi>Is</hi> Ephraim <hi>my dear Son? is he my pleaſant childe?</hi> ſuch a welcome will thy ſoul find with God. Therefore when God humbles thee for ſin, goe thou, and gage thy heart, as it is in the Prophet, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 8.7. God ſhewed him <hi>a little hole,</hi> then hee ſaw <hi>a little,</hi> but God bid him <hi>digge,</hi> till he had <hi>found a door;</hi> and then <hi>he ſaw worſe and viler abominations:</hi> So when God, through ſome creviſe or peeping hole hath ſhewed thee ſome ſmall ſins; digge fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into thine heart, and thou ſhalt ſee more, and greater, to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:168555:43"/>bewail before the Lord. And juſtifie him in all thy ſufferings for thoſe ſins.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.4. God ſpake to him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted him, and he juſtified the Lord in doing ſo: that is, he acknowledged, the Lord dealt graciouſly, and mercifully with him, in ſo afflicting him. <hi>He puts his mouth in the duſt,</hi> Lam. 3.29. <hi>If there may be any hope;</hi> he ſits alone, and keeps ſilence, and bethinks himſelf, ſaying, What have I done? It is a good courſe for a ſinner to take, under his affliction to cry, The Lord is righteous, and I am wicked: I have reaſon rather to wonder, the Lord hath laid no more upon me, than to murmure that he hath laid ſo much, knowing that, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.13. <hi>God hath puniſhed us leſſe than our iniquities deſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 Take with thee a word of confeſſion, and ſupplication,
<note place="margin">Pray for abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to come.</note> and acknowledge thy ſelf a ſtranger to private Communion, and ſecret Duties with thy God; and then ſet thy ſelf about the performance of them, though thou beeſt unskilful in them. Thou needeſt but <hi>take words,</hi> Hoſ. 14.2. for God will put them into thy heart and mouth, and thine own neceſſity will ſuggeſt much unto thee. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.23. <hi>The poor man ſpeaks ſupplications.</hi> Hee that never knew what beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meant, yet when hee is pinched with poverty, will be able to pray: The little childe that can but ſtammer, will tell his Father where the pain is, and begge ſome help of him: ſo it will be with thee. Thus could <hi>Paul</hi> doe it preſently, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11. <hi>Behold he praies.</hi> The word ſignifies continuance in prayer, he prays and prays again, three daies together. <hi>Jacob</hi> meeting with the Lord as an enemy, wraſtled with him in prayer, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.4. doe thou likewiſe. It is in vain to ſtand poring on thine afflicted condition, but run for help, and as the poor Widow ſerved the unjuſt Judge, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.4, 5. weary God with thy complaints, never let him reſt, till hee give thee a yeelding anſwer; according to that promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.6, 7.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Adventure upon the grace of God in Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Caſt thy ſelf on his mercy.</note> caſt thy ſelf on his mercy, as did the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.18. ſaying, <hi>I will ariſe and goe to my Father, &amp;c.</hi> what hope could ſuch a Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond wretch have, of his Fathers acceptance? yet he thought
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:168555:44"/>it beſt to adventure upon this courſe. Thinks hee, if I muſt periſh, I will periſh at my Fathers door; you know how hee ſped. Juſt like thoſe Lepers in the gate of <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 King. 7.4. Mind their ſucceſſe.</p>

So 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. Chriſt ſaid to the polluted child, <hi>lying in his bloud, live,</hi> Ezek. 16. <hi>Chriſt calls not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but ſinners,</hi> great and foul ſinners, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. yea his bitter enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 8, 10. <hi>When wee were enemies, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt hath opened a door to the vileſt ſinner.</p>

<note place="margin">Conſider the large offer.</note> 
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.9.

This ſtandard no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite rage of the wicked can ever pluck down; but it ſhall be reſt to them that gather unto it, though ſinners have no reſt in themſelves. <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent, that all might look unto it for cure of their ſtingings: ſo is Chriſt lifted on the Croſſe, that all may ſee a Redeemer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15. and ſo lifted up in the Word, that every wounded ſoul in the world, may hear him ſpeaking peace to them that are near, and to them that are afarre off; and if Chriſt hath appointed himſelf to bee lifted up to all poor undone Sinners, then ſee that you ſlight not your remedy, but come, lifting up your heads with joy, for your redemption draws nigh.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Conſider how <hi>ſerious an offer</hi> the Lord makes of Chriſt Crucified,

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:168555:44"/>for all commers.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O proſecute this point yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, take a ſecond uſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, for the <hi>Members of Chriſt,</hi> that have an intereſt in this ſatisfaction, to conſider the ſeveral Duties, this truth calls them to.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It calls to bitter mourning for ſin all our dayes:
<note place="margin">Chriſts mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould mourn for ſin.</note> It ſhould maintain a conſtant ſpring of godly ſorrow in our hearts, to conſider what the Lord Jeſus hath undergone for us, and what wrong and injury wee have done him. For the clearing which, minde that famous place, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. The Lord ſaith, <hi>I will pour out upon the houſe of</hi> David, <hi>and the inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>the Spirit of grace, and ſupplication; and they ſhall look upon him whom they have peirced, and they ſhall mourn for him, &amp;c.</hi> This place concerns properly the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but typically, the whole Church of Chriſt. And it imports, that they ſhall have ſuch a work of God upon their hearts; that they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:168555:45"/>ſhall look upon Chriſt crucified, by faith, and mourn, that themſelves have peirced him; and that hee was wounded for their iniquities, and bruiſed for their tranſgreſſions: and not only for them, but by them, yea by every ſin that hath been committed by them. Thus ſhould every Chriſtian doe, that hath any intereſt in Chriſts ſufferings; even to be in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe for every ſin, <hi>as a man is in bitterneſſe for his only Son.</hi> Which expreſſion hints to us the manner, meaſure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their mourning. You know, Parents mourning for a Son, and an only Son, and a Son whom themſelves have murthered with their own hands, is very bitter: tongues can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expreſſe it, but tender Parents may imagine it: and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> mourning for <hi>Abſolon</hi> repreſents it, with <hi>Rachels</hi> grief, <hi>that would not be comforted.</hi> It is again compared, to the <hi>mourning of the valley of Hadadrimmon, &amp;c.</hi> that is, as the mourning of <hi>Judah, Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> for the death of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> ſlain by <hi>Pharaoh Necho,</hi> 2 Chro. 35.24, 25. which was exceeding bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as appears, in that the Singing-men, and Singing-women ſpeak of <hi>Joſiah</hi> in their Lamentations to this day: yea they compoſed ſolemn Lamentations for <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and made it an Ordinance in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould lament for him in after times. Such a mourning ſhould that bee, of the members of Chriſt, for him whom their ſins have peirced, upon theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That thou mayeſt not ſay,
<note place="margin">Grounds of Saints mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> the <hi>Jewes</hi> only ſlew the Lord Jeſus, and that thou hadſt no hand in it. Bee aſſured that Chriſt was wounded for, and by the ſins of all thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4, 5. yea, there is never a ſin, that any of the Elect ever did, doe, or ſhall commit, but peirced Chriſt. If he ſuffered not for it, it cannot be forgiven. All the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Devil and all, could not have deſtroyed Chriſt, had not the ſins of the elect met on him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The killing Chriſt is a farre fouler bloud-guiltineſſe, than ever <hi>David</hi> incurred: than to kill an only Son: or to murther a <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a King, a godly King: for this is the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lord of glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. and may therefore well be lamented.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The love we owe, and bear to Chriſt, for his unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd condeſcentions, to make us heirs of glory, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:168555:46"/>our hearts, to weep for his death, as he did for <hi>Lazarus's</hi> death, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.35, 56. which the <hi>Jewes</hi> took notice of, to be the probate of his love: <hi>Behold how he loved him.</hi> Thus Chriſt imputes the repenting tears, of that ſinful woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47. to love. Chriſts great graciouſneſſe makes the moſt ſtony heart to lament its provocations.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The ſenſe of our dreadful, and undone eſtate, that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the death of Chriſt, to eſtabliſh a Covenant of Grace with us, ſhould provoke us to bee in bitterneſſe: as God expects. <hi>Ezeck.</hi> 16.62, 63. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with thee, and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord. That thou mayeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified toward thee; for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 The Spirit of grace and ſupplication is now poured forth, into the ſoul; and that Spirit is a ſpirit of Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and works and continues, a broken and contrite ſpirit, in all that receive it; as it did in thoſe Converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>Pricking them to the heart,</hi> for all their wrongs and injuries put upon Chriſt, for embruing their hands in his precious bloud.</p>
            <p>Look back therefore upon thy pleaſure that thou haſt taken in ſin; and with what greedineſſe thou haſt committed it: and compare them with Chriſts ſufferings, and what hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at thy hands; that it may break thy heart, as it did <hi>Davids,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.7, 8. when hee had long lain in a ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering condition, and God told him, how much he had done for him; wondring that after ſo much love, he ſhould deſpiſe his Commandements, and make ſo wretched a requital. How doth he cry out upon his ſins, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. and loathes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But a Chriſtian ſhould rejoyce in the Croſſe of Christ, how then comes it to be the object of ſorrow? Sure</hi> Paul <hi>thought otherwiſe,</hi> Gal. 6.14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi>
               <note place="margin">How the Croſſe is a ground of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing as well as of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> It is true, Chriſts Croſſe is a ground of rejoycing as well as a ground of ſorrow: Of ſorrow, in reſpect of that hand we had in his death, the wounds which our ſins gave him, the hard dealing, and unkind requital, he hath received for all his love: Of joy, in reſpect of the benefits, and good
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:168555:46"/>we receive by his death. Let us therefore maintain a ſpring of godly ſorrow, for our ſins; and ſtreams of joy for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings we receive by him: which is the true eating the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, with <hi>bitter Herbs,</hi> Exod. 12.8. Alſo making <hi>confeſſion of their ſins,</hi> Levit. 16.21. The Papiſts have a ſeeming pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this duty, keeping Good-friday in penance and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, ſetting up a Crucifix before them, and zealouſly hating the <hi>Jewes</hi> for putting Chriſt to death; but think not of their own ſins, that they had a hand in it. To whom Chriſt might juſtly ſay, as to the Women weeping at his Croſſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23, 28. <hi>O yee daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves;</hi> for your ſins, whereby you have woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me: which is the duty of every Chriſtian.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Upon the conſideration of Chriſts extream ſufferings for Sin, the Members of Chriſt are preſſed hard,
<note place="margin">Chriſts mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould hate ſin.</note> to hate every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil way, and to ſhun all ſin for ever.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe it was one end of Chriſts crucifying,
<note place="margin">To hate ſin is the end of Chriſts death.</note> that ſin and the fleſh ſhould be crucified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. that, <hi>They that are Christs have crucified the fleſh:</hi> (underſtanding by the fleſh, the corruption of Nature, with the affections, and luſts of it.) Chriſts members ſhould pluck up the very roots of ſin, the very inward luſts that grow in the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, that our Old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might bee deſtroyed;</hi> that is, the whole corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may be killed by the death of Chriſt; yet not ſo farre as to free us from all ſin, but that we might not <hi>ſerve</hi> ſin, or <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it in the luſts thereof.</hi> For this cauſe did Chriſt bear our ſin upon the Croſſe, <hi>That we being dead unto ſin, might live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to righteouſneſſe,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. That is, that we ſhould behave our ſelves like dead men, not to be moved nor inticed to ſin. For firſt, this was the end which God propounded to himſelf, in his Sons death, to deſtroy ſin. Wee muſt be very careful, how we fruſtrate the end of God, in our giving way to ſin. Secondly, Chriſt hath by his death merited the death of ſin, and ſo we are ſaid to dye with Chriſt, and ſo bee freed from ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.7. Thirdly, adde to this, the efficacy of Chriſts death, which works the ruine of ſin in all his members. Hence <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. wee read of a power and force in the death of Chriſt, to make us <hi>conformable to his death:</hi> while his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:168555:47"/>is killing ſin in us. So that Chriſts death hath no comfort, for them that hate not ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Our ſin killed Chriſt;
<note place="margin">We muſt hate ſin becauſe it killed Chriſt.</note> if then wee have any love to Chriſt, wee muſt needs kill ſin. Pſal. 97.10. <hi>Yee that l ve the Lord, hate evil. The Love of Chriſt conſtraineth us to it.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14. The law of Nature makes a man, that hee cannot indure the ſight of one that hath killed his father, or his dear Friend: but his very heart will riſe againſt him; and hee cannot chooſe but follow the Law upon him, to the utmoſt, to hang him, if all the law in the World will do it. And can wee bee ſo unnatural, that ſin ſhould deſtroy our deareſt Saviour, and we not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged upon it? How ſhould wee bee tranſported with Indignation at ſin, that brought on our Redeemer the pains both of the firſt and ſecond death? Then let us purſue our ſins with all poſſible deteſtations; if wee let them go, wee are no Friends to Chriſt. Let us ſtab them to the heart, till they bleed their laſt, that drew the blood of Chriſt. Let them never come to any San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, or City of refuge; but as Avengers of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, let us leave ſin no ſhift, no way to eſcape. Let us ſay to them as <hi>David</hi> to the young man, that told him hee had ſlain <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 Sam. 1.14. <hi>How waſt thou not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to ſtretch out thy hand, to deſtroy the Lords annointed?</hi> and <hi>David</hi> commanded him ſtrait to bee ſlain; do thou likewiſe. Reaſon thus alſo againſt all temptations: theſe ſins were the death of my Saviour, and why ſhould they bee my delight? They pierced his hands and feet, and wounded his ſoul, and why ſhould they be contentment to mine? God forbid.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Minde the deſert of ſin,
<note place="margin">We muſt fear ſin becauſe it cruſhed Chriſt</note> and the ſevere proceedings of God againſt it, in Chriſt our ſurety. Luke 23.31. <hi>If this be done in the green tree, what will bee done in the dry?</hi> Chriſt was the Green tree full of ſap, exceeding fruitful, the true vine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1. the very embleme of fruitfulneſs; yea, the <hi>tree of life,</hi> Rev. 2.7. yet this could not exempt him from his ſharpeſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Chriſt was free from all ſin in his nature, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelf could find nothing in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.46. but we have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:168555:47"/>a World of wickedneſs in us. Chriſt was full of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. and wee full of wickedneſs, yet God ſpared not his Son: <hi>where ſhall wee ungodly and ſinners appear?</hi> Chriſt was the onely begotten, and wee are in compariſon ſtrangers: if hee had no tenderneſs to his Son, what can his Slaves hope for? Chriſt was both God and Man in perſonal Union, ſtrengthened by Angels, yet what Agony? what tears? what conflicts did hee undergo? wee are but ſtubble, but a rotten ſtick, fit fuel for everlaſting burnings; how ſhall wee ſtand in the day of tryal? <hi>O it is a fearful thing, to fall into the hands of the living God,</hi> Heb. 10.31. Oh that wee had hearts to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the evil of ſin, before wee come to feel it! Bleſſed are they that beleeve, and fear, and tremble, and never experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally know, the vileneſs of ſin. God ſeeing the hardneſs of our hearts, hath manifeſted the evil of ſin, by the ſufferings of Chriſt; a better argument, then all the curſes, racks, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell it ſelf, could produce, to demonſtrate the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nature of it. This may convince the hardeſt hearts in the world; and let the very godly themſelves ſee, that ſin is more vile, than ever they imagined it to bee.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Know that ſin will kill us, as well as it killed Chriſt, if wee prevent not the malignity of it. Death is the proper wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin, both the firſt and ſecond death.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But a Childe of God is in no danger of ſinning, nor of eternal puniſhment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Surely 'tis true Doctrin, that 1 Pet. 4.17, 18. <hi>The time is come that judgement muſt begin at the houſe of God.</hi> Wee know how Churches have ſmarted for ſin, for little ſins in the Worlds account. The Jews caſt off for unbeleef:
<note place="margin">Saints correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though not damned, for ſin.</note> the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> for forſaking her firſt love: <hi>Laodicea</hi> for lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, threatned to bee diſ-Churched: Add that, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.6. the deſtroying Angel had a charge, to begin at Gods ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Yea, many godly men ſmart for their boldneſs in ſin, here in this World. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. and yet tells them, <hi>If you live in the fleſh? yee ſhall dye,</hi> and ſpeaks not onely of a temporal, but eternal death. You will ſay 'tis not poſſible for Saints to dye eternally. I anſwer, 'tis as poſſible for Saints to dye eternally, as to ſin eternally. Let all men
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:168555:48"/>look to it, for ſin continued in, will certainly deſtroy all its practitioners.</p>
            <p>Having therefore theſe conſiderations. Let us dread to have any thing to do with ſin. This conſideration is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to this very end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, 3. that the ſight of what Chriſt endured by ſin, might make us conſtant and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in withſtanding all the fiery darts of the Devil, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining every evil way, ſtriving againſt it unto blood, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. as Chriſt did to the very death; not refuſing the <hi>worſt</hi> of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
<note place="margin">The worſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is better than the beſt ſin.</note> to eſchew the <hi>beſt</hi> of ſins; to part with your heart blood, as well as your good names, eaſe, and profit, if God call you to it. Thus doth <hi>Peter</hi> argue, 1 Pet. 4.1, 2. <hi>Forasmuch then as Chriſt hath ſuffered in the fleſh for us, let us arm our ſelves likewiſe with the ſame minde: for hee that hath ſuffered in the fleſh, hath ceaſed from ſin, that hee no longer ſhould live, the rest of his life in the fleſh, to the luſts of men, &amp;c.</hi> The iſſue of the words is this, The Faithful have Union and Communion with Chriſt, and therefore they muſt bee conformable to Chriſt in Holineſſe: but muſt ceafe from ſinne, arguing thus.</p>
            <p>That if wee have loſt our head for ſin, it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we ſhould live in ſin any longer; but we have loſt our head for ſin. Or thus, All they dyed in Chriſt for ſin, for whoſe ſin Chriſt dyed: and they that dyed once for ſin, cannot ſin any more. If therefore thou continueſt to ſin, how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveſt thou that Chriſt dyed for thee? Let thy conſcience bee the judge.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Hath Chriſt loved us ſo dearly,
<note place="margin">Chriſts death merits our love that merited heaven for us.</note> as to ſuffer ſuch dreadful torments for us, then what ſhall wee do for Chriſt? O man, return this day an Anſwer to the Lord, what courſe thou wilt take to walk ſuitable to his kindneſs. When <hi>David</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deliverance from God, hee ſaies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.1. I will love thee dearly, O Lord my ſtrength. God ſhewed him much love, and hee intends to make a retaliation. And indeed love is the Load-ſtone of love. Never was ſuch love ſhown, as that of Chriſt. Rev. 1.5. <hi>Who loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi> Eph. 5.2. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us,</hi> his life and blood, and all. Yea, hee parted with his fathers love, which was a thouſand times better than life, for us: Hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came accurſed that might have been bleſſed. Let us not bee
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:168555:48"/>ſcanty in our love to him, but give him our heart, both free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and liberally to the death: his death well merits our love that merits heaven for us. Where Chriſt hath laid ſuch deep ingagements, ſleepy, faint, good wiſhes, will not ſerve the turn. Love in Chriſt was ſtronger than death, 'tis pitty that any cold velleities of love and ſervice, ſhould bee our ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. All bleſſings of the World ſhould endear us, more and more to the Lord; but oh what an Obligation ſhould it bee, that Chriſt became a Curſe for us? The very Maſter-piece of all mercies and bleſſings to the Elect: yea, it gives a ſweet ſeaſoning to all our bleſſings, which have a Curſe cleaving to them, for all that are out of Chriſt, turning all their ſweet morſels into the poyſon of Aſps, or into gravel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32. yea, their proſperity is deſtructive. Alas! what are Riches? and Accommodations? and good fare? when the Lord once charges Sin upon the conſcience? what is it to bee rich and reprobate? to bee deliciouſly fed with the rich Glutton, and a damned creature? The World is a Priſon, and Riches are ſhakels, Creatures are enemies, all wee have is vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vexation of ſpirit; all bleſſings turned into curſings,
<note place="margin">Mercies are curſes without Chriſts death.</note> yea, and all Ordinances, gifts, parts, duties, &amp;c. without Chriſts blood, are but carnal things. You ſay, how doth that appear? why, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. thoſe are alone ſpiritual bleſſings, that are given us <hi>in Chriſt.</hi> Yea, they are dead, and deadly things without Chriſt; for the <hi>letter killeth.</hi> 'Tis his <hi>Divine power</hi> that ſets all a work, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p>Let us then fix our thoughts therefore on Chriſts ſufferings: not onely now and then, giving them a ſlight glance or two, as they come in our way. Let us dwell on the Meditation of his infinite love, till our hearts are warmed, and inlarged by it; till it kindles heavenly affections in us, till his love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains us to every good duty. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. 'Tis that the greateſt part of the World never knew: God hath not ſhewed his love to all people. Let Chriſts love therefore work love in thee, out-biding all other loves. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.37. to hate the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beſt things in nature, in compariſon of Chriſt: yea, our love to Chriſt ſhould make us bold to attempt anything com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him. So it wrought in <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 21.13. <hi>I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to dye for the name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> And <hi>if any man love him
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:168555:49"/>not.</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.22. <hi>Let him bee accurſed, till the Lord come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 Let this Argument inforce brotherly love. 'Tis the Holy Ghoſts own inference,
<note place="margin">We cannot beſtow our love better than on them whom Chriſt loves.</note> 1 Joh. 4.11. <hi>If Christ ſo loved us, wee ought to love one another.</hi> For wee ought to love them beſt that Chriſt loved beſt. Wee cannot beſtow our affections better, than where Chriſt hath beſtowed his: Now Chriſt hath beſtowed his deareſt bowels on the Saints: ſo alſo ought we to bee tender of each other. Far be it from any Chriſtian, to bee of the mind of <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, to hate him the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Father <hi>Jacob</hi> loved him; or becauſe: the Saints have more grace, or more infirmities than our ſelves.

               <hi>That through the Sacrifice of Chriſt, God is pacified and appeaſed with all thoſe that have fellowſhip with Chriſt.</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1, 2. Chriſt is called our <hi>propitiation</hi> in the abſtract. Signifying, that all which is requiſite to pacify Gods anger againſt us, is laid up in Chriſt, and his Death: there needeth nothing more but onely the pleading of his merit with the Father, which alſo Chriſt himſelf doth as our Advocate. 1 Joh. 4.10. <hi>God ſent his Son to bee the propitation for our ſins.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.10. Rom. 5.9 <hi>Being juſtified by his blood, wee ſhall bee ſaved from wrath through him.</hi> This was typified by all the Sacrifices, from the beginning of the World.

Or as the Apoſtle, Rom. 11.8. <hi>Concerning the Gospel they are enemies, but as touching Election, they are beloved, for the Fathers-ſake.</hi> So indeed Gods choſen being yet in a natural eſtate, they are enemies to God, and God is an enemy to them, in regard of their ſin: But the ſame are beloved as touching Election, even before their Calling. As <hi>Abſolon</hi> was beloved of <hi>David</hi> as a Son, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a Rebel and Traytor. 2 Two things muſt bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the love of God: his benevolence, and his benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.

Before the Elect do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the wrath of God, and all the effects of that wrath are removed from their perſons, by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt: and they have intereſt in the ſpecial love of God.

Now the ſurety being of Gods own appointment, &amp; the ſatisfaction ſuch every way as cannot be excepted againſt; it muſt needs follow, that God can have no further controverſy with them that are in Chriſt.</p>

<note place="margin">The dreadful condition of thoſe that are not in Chriſt.</note> This ſhews their miſery, that are not in Chriſt, in that they are objects of the diſpleaſure, and wrath of God. What comfort can any poor creature have when God is angry with him? Rom. 1.18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all, &amp;c.</hi> God hath power enough to puniſh ſin, and juſtice that hee will do it; and this hee hath <hi>revealed from heaven,</hi> in thoſe unknown, and unknowable ſufferings of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Let mee ſay to you, as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Agrippa, Do yee beleeve the Prophets, or Apoſtles either?</hi> Oh why ſhould I propound ſuch a queſtion in this place; and in theſe profeſſing daies? Alas, if wee did all beleeve them, why are there ſo many half Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians amongſt us? Do they know the power of thine anger O Lord? as <hi>Moſes, Pſal.</hi> 90.11. Thou that <hi>diddeſt not spare the Angels that ſinned, but caſtedſt them down to Hell, and deliveredſt them unto chains of darkneſs to bee reſerved to the judgement of the great day,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.4. what will thy juſtice and wrath bee to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:168555:51"/>other ſinners? Conſider the Angels, what glorious creatures they were? what an innumerable company there was of them? and what chains of darkneſſe are caſt upon them already? and what further terror of eternal judgement is expected by them, and reſerved for them? and that for one ſin? How comes this to paſs? why, becauſe they have no Chriſt, no propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no Mediatour to ſuffer and ſatisfy for them. Deut. 29.24. <hi>What then meaneth the heat of this great anger?</hi> Even to ſhew thee, that whilſt thou art without Chriſt, thou art in the ſtate of the very Devils: thy glory or excellency ſhall not deliver thee from wrath: any one of thy ſins may make thee eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſerable. <hi>O remember this, and ſhew your ſelves men: bring it again to mind, O ye Tranſgreſſors,</hi> Iſa. 46.8. ſhew your ſelves to have the underſtanding of reaſonable creatures, and that in the knowledge of this. Not ſo much the motions of the Heavens, or any ſuch curious Arts, had need to bee known by you, but the motions of Hell? what rivers of brimſtone are running there, kindled by the wrath of this angry God.</p>

Zach. 7.11, 12. <hi>They refuſed to hearken, and pulled away the ſhoulder, and ſtopped their ears, that they ſhould not hear;</hi> This is the very deſcription of a hard heart. <hi>Oh yee ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of vipers, can yee eſcape the damation of hell?</hi> ſaid our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.33.</p>

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. It may put us upon ſerious enquiry, how the Lord ſtands affected towards each of our perſons: whether his wrath be appeaſed towards us, or no? It is a queſtion requiring the moſt ſerious conſultation, and full reſolution, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.31. ſeeing that God cometh with ſuch force and ſtrength againſt us; It is time to enquire <hi>whether it be peace, or no?</hi> And wee ſhould not reſt until wee could ſay, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.2, 3. And of your ſelves in particular, as 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.9. <hi>God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain ſalvation.</hi> Loc a ſtate of Wrath, is oppoſed to a ſtate of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and ſome there are that are appointed to it. <hi>Ah,</hi> (ſhould every one ſay) <hi>am not I one of thoſe?</hi> This is the firſt Queſtion that muſt be reſolved for our Salvation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.7.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:168555:54"/>This made the Phariſees and Sadduces to make ſome ſhew and ſemblance of Repentance, and flock to the Baptiſm of <hi>John.</hi> And it is the firſt work of the Law of God upon a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. <hi>The Law worketh wrath;</hi> that is, it diſcovers the Wrath of God againſt the ſinner. And it is certain, that till this Work of God be done, and this Queſtion cleared to thy ſoul, thou haſt not taken one ſtep from Wrath and Hell.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This concerns not one or a few actions of ſin, but our ſtate in and under wrath, and all depends on this; if the Lord doth hate our perſons, what hope of peace with him can wee have? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. <hi>They that are in the fleſh,</hi> (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they doe) <hi>they cannot pleaſe God.</hi> If a man know not his eſtate, he knows not what to avoyd, or what to doe, but hee muſt needs goe on in the dark, and worſhip hee knows not what, nor how.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Satan ſtrives to hide this from every ſoul ſo long as hee can. <hi>Hee blindes mens eyes,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.4, 5. 1 By godleſſe cogitations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. 2 By preſumption, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21. 3 By over-charging our hearts with ſenſual luſts, and the cares of this life, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.34. 4 By an evil Conſcience, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. 5 By Idols ſet up in our hearts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20. 6 By the practice, example, and company of evil men of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.48. <hi>Have any of the Rulers beleeved on him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 If a man is a ſtranger to this inquiſition, and unwilling to this ſearch, he is evidently the ſubject of Gods anger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. and alſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 13. and it is a manifeſt token of the Atheiſm of his heart.</p>
            <p n="5">5 There will come times when every ſinner ſhall be forced to enquire into this, and that when it is near paſt hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. As when death approaches, and the anger of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to ſeize us. Then ſhall wee ſay, is not this evil come upon us, becauſe the Lord is not among us? <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.17.29.24, 25. Then will you goe to your rules of conſtructions, and expound the dealings of God with you. Yea, it is well if a ſpirit of utter deſpair, and horror, and aſtoniſhment do not then ſeize upon thee. As it is ſaid of <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.37, 38. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.28.</p>

            <p n="6">6 When that we doe make inquiry at the hearing of the Word, God will take it well at our hands: and when trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome times doe come, we ſhall have the leſſe to doe, and not find them troubleſome. So <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.16. <hi>When I heard, my belly trembled, rottenneſſe entred into my bones, that I might reſt in the day of trouble.</hi> Thus <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 34.21, 22. with the following verſes.</p>
            <p n="7">7 It is a condition extreamly dangerous for a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin with a ſenſleſſe ſpirit, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.24, 25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.18, 19, 20. There is no ſuch fire as the fire of Gods anger kindled againſt a Nation, or perſon, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.3. <hi>A fire devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth before, and behind a flame burneth, the Land is as the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Eden before them, and behind them a deſolate Wilderneſſe, and nothing ſhall eſcape.</hi> So <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22, 23.</p>

The Lord hath forſaken the generation of his wrath,</hi> Jer. 7.29. What though thou doſt not yet feel it; yet conſider what <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith to <hi>Job, Becauſe there is wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware lest he take thee away with his ſtroak, then a great ranſome cannot deliver thee; will he eſteem thy riches, or all the forces of ſtrength?</hi> The greateſt calmes doe uſually goe before the greateſt ſtormes, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.3, 4. doe not thou therefore reſt ſecure upon vain hopes and thoughts, without full inquiry what thy eſtate is, whether this wrath doth not burn againſt thee. The World is at peace with me, and my Neighbours are at peace with me: but is the living God at peace with me? <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.14. <hi>The wrath of a King is a meſſenger of death, but a wiſe man will pacifie it.</hi> When but <hi>Ahaſneroſh</hi> was angry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Haman,</hi> what became of him? <hi>Heſt.</hi> 7.7. What then would the wrath of the King of Kings be? <hi>Who can caſt body and ſoul into hell?</hi> Mat. 12.28.
<note place="margin">How we may know that wee are delivered from the wrath of God?</note>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhall we come to attain to this knowledge of our ſtate?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Beware of judging love or hatred by all theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:168555:55"/>things, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.1, 2. The richneſſe of the lading doth not ſhew the goodneſſe of the Veſſel; the more weighty the lading is, the more danger, if it bee put into a rotten, leakie ſhip. So are this worlds goods, when it is put into a rotten heart. Proſperity is not a certain argument of Gods love; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the other ſide, is adverſity a ſure note thereof.</p>
            <p>Thou mayeſt underſtand much by the dictate and verdict of thine own Conſcience, eſpecially being inlightned and awakned, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God.</hi> The Lord hath appointed the Conſcience, as his Vicegerent in every mans heart, that keeps a regiſter, yea a diary of all that paſſes. The Gentiles had this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. now the conſcience witneſſeth not alone, but together with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1. Thus <hi>Shimei</hi> was privie to his own wickedneſſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.44. And <hi>Balſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> Dan. 5.5, 6. though that hee underſtood not the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, yet horror ſeized upon him, his Conſcience telling him that he was naught, and God was angry with him. You ſhall not need to climbe unto Heaven to know this, but deſcend into your own hearts. <hi>The Conſcience of man is that candle of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 20.27. This diſcovers the works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as <hi>Lying, Swearing, Adultery, Couſenage, Drunkenneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 17.1. and to deſpiſe this is to deſpiſe God, and his wrath kindled againſt the ſoul: and if thou doſt ſhuffle over matters now, there is a day coming when thy Conſcience will not be ſhuffled off. This notary hath taken notice of thy moſt ſecret faults, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. thus the Church confeſſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.12. <hi>Our tranſgreſſions are with us, and as for our iniquities we know them.</hi> When Conſcience doth therefore admoniſh of any ſin, doe not ſay to it as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Joab,</hi> 2 Sam. 11.25. <hi>Let not this trouble thee, it is as the common chance of men.</hi> This ſin troubled <hi>David</hi> with a witneſſe afterwards. Now hee ſlighted it, but afterwards he did ſink under it, and was troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4. to <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. ſo if thou doeſt not obſerve its admonitions now, it will upbraid thee afterwards, as <hi>Reuben,</hi> Gen. 42.21. <hi>Did not I ſay unto you, ſin not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Come to the cleareſt light of the Word of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21. <hi>He that doth the truth, comes to the light, &amp;c.</hi> Bee yee not as Batts and Owls that decline the light, <hi>this will bee a lamp
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:168555:55"/>to thy feet, and a lauthorn to thy paths,</hi> Pſal. 119.105. that will keep thee from falling, and diſcover thy filthineſſe to thee, and ſhew thee the way to purge it, whatever thy eſtate bee, it will doe thee good.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Conſider it is moſt certain, that all that are children of men, are children of wrath, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. This was thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from the Wombe: and doe not ſtand to plead that thou art born in faederal holineſſe: for this doth not exempt any ſoul from being a childe of wrath, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Paul</hi> had faederal holineſſe, <hi>he was circumſized the eighth day, an Hebrew of the Hebrews,</hi> yet born a childe of wrath. Neither was it his ſtate alone, but every ones that hath the nature of man. And if I be born ſo, I ſtill am ſo; unleſſe I can ſhew that I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from it; yea I have brought more wrath upon my ſoul, by every ſin I have committed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. when it was told that there was but one Traytor among the Diſciples: they all enquired, <hi>Lord, is it I? Matth.</hi> 26.22. But we are all under wrath. Thoſe that are diſaffected to the word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.10. They that pray not, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10. <hi>ult. Eph.</hi> 5.6. Scorners, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.24.19.29. therefore let not Satan put it away from us, neither ſuffer wee our hearts to return and goe off this conſideration; until they have brought in a deliberate anſwer unto this.</p>
            <p n="5">5 See whether you have ever had this propitiation or no. You ſee there is but one means to appeaſe wrath, it is the Wrath of God, and therefore infinite: and none but a ſacrifice of infinite value can appeaſe it. And this being grounded in our very nature, it is impoſſible that any meer creature can turn it away. It is Chriſts peculiar.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How may we know that Chriſt hath done it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

Laſtly, ſee this by the peace that the bloud of Chriſt hath wrought in thy ſoul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But hath every one peace of Conſcience, that hath inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in the bloud of Chriſt?</hi>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Every one hath peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. and though it doth not always quiet the conſcience, yet it ſtayes the heart with ſome waiting upon God, and purges the conſcience every day more and more. See whether thou findeſt this in thee.</p>

Is there any child of peace here that will hear it, and give it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment? And know, that though you ſhould not regard it, yet the Kingdom of God is come nigh to you, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will one day find it upon the file for a teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you. And hereafter will wiſdom ſay, <hi>Becauſe I have called, &amp;c.</hi> Prov. 1.24, 28. Luk. 19.42.

But he ſaith, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.7, 8. <hi>I will be to them as a Lion, and as a Leopard by the way to obſerve them, &amp;c.</hi> yea the Lord will be more terrible than all theſe.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:168555:57"/>that you ſin not.</hi> So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.5.11. But if you ſhall bee bold to ſin, know, that though God doth love your perſons, yet hee will bee diſpleaſed with your actions, as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> and take vengeance on your inventions.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Learn to make uſe of this propitation of Chriſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2. Not onely before converſion, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame; its ever to bee uſed, more neceſſary than fire and water, meat and drink.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>When ſhould wee more especially make uſe of Christs Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 In our daily relapſes into ſin, which make new defilements, and therefore wee muſt have freſh recourſe to the fountain. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. thus the daily Sacrifice, prefigured the daily uſe of Chriſts ſacrifice for attonement. That 22 <hi>Pſalm</hi> ſetting forth his paſſion, was daily ſung each morning, with the offering up of the Sacrifice, as is judged from its title.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In all our duties and ſervices, whereof the moſt holy have iniquity in them, and therefore ſtand in need of Chriſt, that they may finde acceptance: as was typified, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.38. and their ſacrifices were given into the hand of the Prieſt, and offered by him, ſo our ſpiritual ſervices by Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.</p>

            <p n="4">4 At each Sacrament there ſhould bee a ſolemn remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this propitiatory ſacrifice. Rom. 6.3. <hi>Wee are baptized into his death.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. Its done in remembrance of Chriſt.</p>

               <hi>Return thou back-ſliding</hi> Iſrael, <hi>(ſaith the Lord) I will not cauſe mine anger to paſs upon thee, nor keep it for ever, onely acknowledge thine iniquity, &amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4 Wee are to apprehend and plead by faith and prayer, the Promiſes of God as confirmed to us by the blood of Chriſt. They are all made and performed by him.

As the Prieſt ſprinkled the people, the book, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19, 20, 23.

In reſpect of God, the manifeſtation of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Mercy.</p>
            <p>Now the Meritorious Cauſe is amplyfied. 1 By the degree and meaſure and manner of it: <hi>it was by blood.</hi> 2 By the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of it: <hi>it was a propitiation.</hi> 3 By the ground or manner of it, in the word <hi>[ſet forth]</hi> of which next is this Quere.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the meaning of ſetting forth Chriſt to bee a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt was formerly ſet forth for a Propitiation in
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:168555:59"/>times of the Old Teſtament. But very darkly, under Types and ſhadows, and very reſtrainedly; in that 'twas onely to the Jews, or the Proſelytes that were joyned to them. But now in the New Teſtament, Chriſt is clearly and openly ſet forth in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and without <hi>all</hi> reſtraint both to Jews and Gentiles. 1 Joh. 2.2. <hi>a propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole world.</hi> Heb. 9.7. The Mercy Seat was ſhut up in the times of the Old Teſtament, though the benefit was extended to the whole Church of the Jews, yet to them onely, and ſuch as joyned to them: and beſides, none but the High Prieſt might go into it: and that not commonly, but onely once a year. But now in the times of the New Teſtament, Chriſt our Mercy Seat is ſet forth in the Promiſes and Preaching of the Goſpel, to all ſorts of ſinners, that they have free recourſe to him for themſelves, and that at any time. This I conceive was intended by the Tranſlators in this place: and it is pious and precious.</p>
            <p>The word here uſed, doth often ſignify the purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God from all eternity. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. And of mens purpoſes to do any thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.13. But its eſpecially applyed unto the myſtery of Chriſt, &amp; Gods eternal purpoſe in gathering of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners unto him in one head. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.9. And this ſignification doth marvellouſly ſuit here, to ſhew unto us how it comes to paſs that Chriſt is the <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> or <hi>placatory</hi> ſacrifice for ſin: Even becauſe God the Father purpoſed, and fore-appointed this way of reconciliation from all eternity.</p>
            <p>In regard of the compoſition of the word it may ſignify <hi>[hee propoſed before]</hi> or <hi>[held forth in former times]</hi> viz. In former times by the ſacrifice of the Law, the Mercy Seat, and other types, thus was Chriſt then ſet forth, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.36.</p>
            <p>All theſe interpretations are uſefull, and precious, which I comprehend therefore in this</p>
            <p>Doct.
<note place="margin">Chriſt was purpoſed and propoſed our Propitiation.</note> 
               <hi>That God the Father purpoſed from eternity, and propoſed in fulneſs of time his Son Jeſus Chriſt, to bee the propitiation for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Its much inſiſted on in Scripture, that the eternal decree and purpoſe of God is mentioned as the ground mark of our redemption. 1 Pet. 1.2. <hi>Elect according to the fore-knowledge of God, and the ſanctification of the Spirit, and obedience, and the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168555:59"/>sprinkling of the blood of Jeſus.</hi> Here wee have three works of the divine perſons in the ſalvation of ſouls. The Fathers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, the Sons redemption, and the Spirits application. And theſe two latter are grounded in the former. As alſo, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.9. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.28.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Chriſt was propoſed formerly in the Old Teſtament, I mean in the promiſes, prophecies, and types. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.70. 1 Pet. 1.10, 11. <hi>The Prophets prophecyed of the grace of God in Chriſt, and teſtified before hand of the ſufferings of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 9.22.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Moſt clearly in the Goſpel-times. 1 Pet. 1.20. <hi>The Lamb fore-ordained was manifeſted and offered in our times.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9, 10. <hi>Gods purpoſe and grace was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the World began; but is now made manifeſt by Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. when he came in fleſh; then was the fountain ſet open, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.1.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How was the decree of God the Father, about the propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There was from all eternity, a gracious Covenant betwixt the perſons of the Holy Trinity: as it is expreſſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, &amp;c. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.8. The Father ſaith, <hi>If hee will make his ſoul an offering for ſin, &amp;c.</hi> And the Son ſaith, <hi>Loe I cometo do thy will, my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why did God the Father purpoſe from eternity Chriſt to be our propitiation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No reaſon can bee given, but the good pleaſure of the Lord, Iſa. 53.10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, &amp;c.</hi> Its called the love of God, and the free love of God. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. that hee ſent his Son to bee our propitiation. Nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God whether faith, or works, or perſeverance foreſeen, could move God to purpoſe any mans ſalvation. For I may ſpeak it with reverence; God could not foreſee any mans faith and good works, except hee had decreed to give faith, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience too, himſelf.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why did God propoſe in the times of the Old Teſtament Chriſts propitiation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It was neceſſary for the ſalvation of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect before the comming of Chriſt: <hi>there being no ſalvation to be had in any other but him,</hi> Act. 4.12. and no ſalvation by Chriſt, but by his ſacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. but this is certain that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:168555:60"/>their ſalvation, and therefore appointed the means thereof; that is, <hi>the propoſal of the Sacrifice, and propitiation of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.19.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It was neceſſary for after times: for hence it is, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did Preach ſtill out of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, If they had one way of ſalvation, and wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, then there would have been more waies to heaven than one: and that would have endangered our ſalvation: for wee ſhould have been left in doubt and ſuſpicion which way to take. But the Scripture ſhews us that wee muſt bee ſaved, as the fathers were, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.11.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why was Chriſts ſacrifice propoſed ſo openly, ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In reſpect of the Elect, both Jews and Gentiles, that both might ſee their free admittance to him, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in him, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. cap. &amp; 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In reſpect of the reprobates, that they might be left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, and Gods juſtice cleared in their deſtruction, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1.
<note place="margin">The hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſin who do neglect Chriſt.</note> This may ſerve to diſcover the hainouſneſſe of their ſin, that do either neglect or deſpiſe Chriſts Sacrifice or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation. For, 1 Conſider that that revelation of Chriſt in the Old Teſtament (though but dark and imperfect) yet was ſufficient and effectual unto the ſalvation of all the Elect then; the Patriarks and Prophets, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 1.29. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. Could the Ceremonies and the ſhadows ſave? how much more Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the body it ſelf, as hee is now revealed? Could they ſee the Promiſes afar off, and embrace them then? And wee when they are near at hand put them away from us? Had they but the predictions of Chriſts death, and were ſaved by it, and wee are not, who have the full accompliſhed thereof? God reſerved for us theſe better things: ſad and very ſinful is it, if wee become never the better, but the worſe, Act. 13.32, 33. <hi>The Promiſe which God made unto the Fathers, hee hath fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto us their children,</hi> the neglect of theſe muſt needs be a more hainous ſin, for which, the Patriarks and Prophets of old, ſhall ſtand up in the judgement, and condemn us.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe Chriſt is ſo generally, and freely offered to all that will receive him. Rev. 22.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him come
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:168555:60"/>and take of the waters of life freely.</hi> What can men ſay, but that their deſtruction is now of themſelves wholly: and that they are ſelf-murtherers. This will make the fire of Hell furnace, ſeven times hotter than ordinary, and worſe than <hi>Sodomes</hi> Hell: to think how ready and open the way to the Mercy Seat was, and nothing hindered thee from it, but thine own vile heart. To ſee perſons, worſe ſinners than thy ſelf ſaved in Heaven, and thou thruſt out. Mat. 8.11, 12. <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt, and Weſt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Its aggravated by this, that Jeſus Chriſt was the onely propitiation determined of God, for ſinners, from everlaſting; both his perſon, and the manner of his redemption. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.11. And hence (unleſs wee could null the Counſel of God) its impoſſible to finde any other propitiation. No equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent price for mans redemption beſides this, No Mercy Seat but meerly this. By Gods decree the matter is eternally li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that there is not any other way than by Chriſts death. <hi>How ſhall wee eſcape if wee neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> Heb. 2.2, 3. what recompence of vengeance can bee ſufficient for this ſin: not onely if wee <hi>despiſe,</hi> or <hi>ſcorn,</hi> but if wee <hi>neglect,</hi> or <hi>care</hi> not for this ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Now hee that doth take care about this ſalvation will uſe all means, rowl every ſtone, take any pains about it, will as <hi>Darius, Dan.</hi> 6.14, 18. Set his heart to the matter, cared for it, laboured about it, paſſed the night without his accuſtomed meal, his muſick, or his ſleep? and early, and in haſte aroſe, and went unto <hi>Daniel</hi> whom he cared for: thus 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. Now if this bee the true care, then thoſe who have no fixed, ſettled, ſerious thoughts about their ſalvation; That will not abate one jot of their ſinful delights, nor carnal contentments for it; but let the word they have heard, heedleſly to ſlip from them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. How is it poſſible they ſhould eſcape? weigh ſeriouſly but that one Scripture, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. to the end.
<note place="margin">Comfort to thoſe that have intereſt in Chriſt, thus propoſed and purpoſed for their propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Of comfort unto the Children of God, who have part in Chriſt, their comfort lies in theſe branches; 1 The propoſal of Chriſt in the Promiſes and Prophecies of the old Teſtament. This wee are ſure is that good old way, in which the Saints were ſaved then, as Now. <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.14. <hi>Will a man leave the Snow of</hi> Lebanon <hi>that commeth from the rock of the field,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:168555:61"/>Or ſhall the cold flowing waters bee forſaken?</hi> That is, Will a man leave the pure fountain water, to come to dig puddles? as <hi>Jerem.</hi> 2.13. as many now-adaies do. Our path is the path of all the Saints of former ages. Wee follow the cloud of Witneſſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. And may hope to bee in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, that Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, while that we inſiſt in the faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 In the propoſal of Chriſt ſo clearly and largely in the times of the New Teſtament, confirmed by the voice of God, and ſo many ſigns and wonders wrought, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.4. here is great comfort that our ſouls are in the right way to bliſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In the eternal purpoſe of God to make Chriſt our Propitiation: When wee conſider the ſleights of Satan, and our own weakneſſes, wee have cauſe to ſay that we ſhall one day fall. But then <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. 2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>The purpoſe of God according to Election will ſtand,</hi> when hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth ſhall fall. <hi>The Foundation of God ſtands ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it were a Foundation of mans laying, it would not bee ſure; but its the Lords, that never was, nor will bee ſhaken. Our Salvation is not built upon our Faith, our Works, or any ſufficiency in our ſelves, or in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; But on Gods Eternal Wiſdome, and Counſel, and unchangeable Decree: and on his Son Jeſus, as our Foundation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. &amp; 1 Pet. 2.6. <hi>Behold, I lay in</hi> Sion <hi>a chief Corner ſtone, Elect and pretious, and hee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves on him ſhall not bee confounded.</hi> Let him therefore be exceedingly comforted, and take up <hi>Pauls</hi> triumphing Challenge, and ſay, Rom. 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? its God that juſtifieth, its Chriſt that dyed.</hi> This is a ſure breaſt-work againſt all Satans batteries and Accuſations. So Tit. 1.2. <hi>Wee have hope of eternal life, promiſed us by an unalterable purpoſe, and that from eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>How can that bee, ſeeing before the World began, there was no Creature to make the Promiſe to?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will not trouble you with other Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:168555:61"/>but this is the truth; That God the Father promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the ſecond Perſon of the ſacred Trinity, his own Son, To give eternal life to all thoſe that ſhould beleeve upon him in the fulneſs of time. And its ſuitable to that, 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with a holy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us in Chriſt before the world began.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shall wee now ſay, that wee are unworthy of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or Mercy? Its very true, we in our ſelves are altogether unworthy: But Jeſus Chriſt our Redeemer is worthy to have it made to him, and performed to him. <hi>The Lamb that was ſtain is worthy.</hi> And immediately, only, to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt were the promiſes made, not to us; and that before the World began: ſo that they are in a good way, and a ſure hand; there's nothing ſucceeding can diſanul, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. nor ſhould diſcourage us, from taking hold thereon.</p>

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. This ſhews the gratious and wonderful concurrence,
<note place="margin">The concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the perſons in Trinity to our ſalvation.</note> of all the perſons of the Trinity in the ſalvation of a ſinner. Here is the Fathers purpoſe and eternal decree, the Sons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation, the holy Spirits application of it implyed in the work of Faith in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>A great miſtake therefore it is, for any to think, that we do owe much more to Chriſt for our ſalvation, than wee do to God the Father: as if hee did carry it but <hi>justly,</hi> nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <hi>ſeverely,</hi> towards us: in Chriſt onely was mercy. Why, Conſider 1. That the juſtice of God is an an eſſential attribute common to all the three perſons; &amp; that <hi>juſt will</hi> to puniſh ſin, or that wrath of God againſt it, is alike in them all. Therefore there is no greater enemy to ſinners, than the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Though Chriſt only did take fleſh upon him and ſuffer, yet this was now brought about by the Fathers Councel and decree. Joh. 3.16. <hi>Hee gave his Son.</hi> Rom. 8.32. <hi>Hee spared not his Son.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> God the Father is the fountain of the God-head in order of ſubſiſting; And ſo hee is in all the works of grace, that are wrought for ſinners. It was his love that moved him to appoint this way of ſalvation, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Chriſts ſatisfaction and ſacrifice was no cauſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love, but an effect thereof, and a chief means of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.9. The cauſe of a ſinners <hi>ſalvation,</hi> but not the cauſe why hee is elected and choſen of God <hi>unto ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 It was the wonderful free love of God the Father, to give any of us in particular to Jeſus Chriſt, and to determine <hi>us</hi> to bee of that ſmall number that were to be reconciled to him by Jeſus Chriſt. Joh. 17.6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore its ſaid, Joh. 5.23. <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son, as they do honour the Father;</hi> that is, with <hi>like</hi> love, but not with <hi>greater</hi> love. Let us therefore learn to glorify God in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11. for though wee may direct our worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one perſon, yet wee muſt take heed of excluding the other in our ſecret thoughts, and of ſetting up, and honouring one perſon above the other: for this were to make an Idol of God, and to divide the perſons one from another, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.11.</p>

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 5. Inſtruction and Exhortation, 1 To them that are yet under wrath, to ſhew them what they muſt do to obtain this Propitiation. In general. What it appears that God purpoſes, and chooſes and propoſes; wee muſt, as it may concern our ſelves, purpoſe chooſe &amp; propoſe unto our ſelves; for this is to bee according to Gods own heart. And if the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the reaſonable Creature bee to bee ſo, then the more wee are conformable unto the will of God, the more excellent our condition is. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. laſt verſe. And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that wee muſt chooſe and receive Chriſt, as God the Father hath purpoſed and ſet forth Chriſt. The Father pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Chriſt onely for our Propitiation. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 Cor. 2.2. <hi>I have determined to know nothing among you, but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> God the Father <hi>delighteth</hi> in Chriſt, wee ſhould take him as our <hi>beloved.</hi> Hee hath ſet him forth as a <hi>Prince,</hi> wee ſhould <hi>ſubmit</hi> unto him, &amp;c. Every grace of God to man, worketh a like ſuitable grace in man. And doubtleſs wee cannot make a better choice, than God the Father hath done.</p>
            <p>In the Old Teſtament Chriſt is ſet forth as a ſure and tryed Propitiation: <hi>ſure</hi> that will never deceive, <hi>tryed</hi> by all the Elect from the beginning of the world. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.16. God the skilfulleſt and moſt faithful builder, laies Chriſt as a foundation, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſure, and of price. As there is no building without a foundation, ſo there is no Church without Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the New Teſtament Chriſts Propitiation is manifeſted free to all. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.12, 13. that which in other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges was not made known, is now moſt clear. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.4, 5.</p>
            <p>After the meaſuring of the Temple, and the clearing up of the Church and Goſpel inſtitutions; there is yet a clearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Mercy Seat, the cover of the Ark, and the Propitiation. Now beloved, the Lord hath brought you, and reſerved you for theſe times: the Temple opened, the Church Ordinances cleared, the Ark and Propitiation ſeen, and Chriſt crucified before your eies. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.8. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. laſt. Oh that wee could weep over many, as Chriſt over <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Many who in this their day of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent viſitation, will not know the things of their peace. And 'tis not onely a bare <hi>notional</hi> knowledge, which no queſtion
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:168555:63"/>the Jews then in ſome meaſure had: but a <hi>ſanctifying,</hi> an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual knowledge. Elſe though you bee children of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, you may bee with them thruſt out. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Though Chriſt bee generally offered in the Goſpel, yet Gods purpoſe hath concluded and determined unchangeably the Propitiation of Christ: And hath ſet down expreſly who the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons are, that ſhall have benefit thereby. And the general of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of Chriſts Propitiation is to ſmall purpoſe, ſeeing that none but the Elect ſhall have benefit thereby?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 The general offer of Chriſt in the Goſpel, doth effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prevail to juſtify and ſave all the Elect, though none elſe beſides have benefit by it. Rom. 11.7. <hi>The Election hath obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, the reſt were blinded.</hi> Thou wert therefore beſt to make thy Election ſure, by embracing the general offer.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Every one is bound to judge charitably of others, much more of himſelf: that hee is of that number of Gods Elect. Eſpecially conſidering that God the Father calls him, by the Miniſtry of the Word of Reconciliation, with as much free and earneſt compellations as any have, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Though many have the outward call, who are not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen: yet ſure it is, that that outward call is uneffectual to none, but thoſe that by their own infidelity and hardneſs of heart do reject it: hence they are ſaid to have <hi>no cloak</hi> or excuſe <hi>for their ſin;</hi> Joh. 15.22.</p>
            <p>There is ſuch an efficacy in the Word of God (even on the worſt of hearers) that it ſearcheth into the cloſeſt corners of their hearts, and convinceth them that they are guilty of their own deſtruction, in not receiving it. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. That which God <hi>will do</hi> is known to himſelf in his ſecret Counſel; But the offer of Chriſt in the Goſpel, this ſhews us <hi>what hee would have us to do:</hi> even to repent and beleeve. Therefore minde we our own duty. God hath ordained the end with the means. And therefore though it were revealed to thee from Heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt certainly bee ſaved: yet I might truely ſay to thee, that except thou beleeve and repent, thou ſhalt periſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 6.
<note place="margin">Of Inſtruction to the godly.</note> Hence is matter of Inſtruction and Exhortation to the faithful. In regard that God the Father hath thus <hi>purpoſed</hi> Chriſt for a Propitiation, they may bee ſtirred up to ſeveral duties.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:168555:64"/>
            <p n="1">1 To ſtrengthen and confirm their faith in Chriſts blood. If wee go to queſtion the ſalvation of Chriſt, then do wee go to make void the Counſel of God, which hath purpoſed him and propoſed him to us for a Saviour. Thoſe chariots, <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.1, 2. they are ſaid to go <hi>forth betwixt two mountains of braſs;</hi> which are nothing but the unchangeable Decree and purpoſe of God. So is the purpoſe of God about Chriſts propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on impregnable: Neither Sin, nor Satan, nor all the World are able to hinder, alter, or remove it. Is there then any fear of miſ-carriage?</p>
            <p>Verily wee have great cauſe to bee humbled for our ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart to beleeve, and for the weakneſs and littleneſs of our Faith: that have ſo many Promiſes, and the oath of God, and the Covenant, and the Seals; and beſide too the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable and abſolute Decree of God, and his purpoſe: which are as ſure as the very being, the eternal being of God. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.9, 10. <hi>I am God, and there is none elſe, I am God, and there is none other like to mee, declaring the end from the beginning, and from the ancient times the things that are not yet done: ſaying, My Counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure,</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>I have spoken it, and I will bring it to paſs, I have purpoſed it, and I will do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo Gods propoſal of Chriſt, in that ſure word of prophecy, in the times of the Old Teſtament, is a great confirmation of our Faith. They deſcribed his perſon, <hi>God-man, Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7, 14. his Offices, and unction. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 2. &amp;c. the place of his birth, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. the manner, <hi>of a Virgin, Iſa.</hi> 7.14. the time of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. after the finiſhing of <hi>Daniels</hi> weeks, when the Scepter was departed from <hi>Judah,</hi> and while the ſecond Temple ſtood, <hi>Haggai</hi> 2.7, 9.</p>
            <p>In the New Teſtament alſo where God hath ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo willing to ſave us, and to bee reconciled to us. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.47. Hee hath broken down the partition wall, hee hath ſent forth his Servants to invite all ſorts, even thoſe that are in the high waies and hedges, hee doth give the meaneſt and vileſt ſinners entertainment and welcome, if they come in at the Miniſtry of the Word. <hi>It is not the will of the Father, that one of theſe little ones ſhould periſh,</hi> Mat. 18.14. All theſe do migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily help to confirm our faith.</p>
            <pb n="119" facs="tcp:168555:64"/>
            <p n="2">2 It ſhould teach us highly to prize this propitiation of Jeſus Chriſt. It was pretious to God the Father, and ſo ought it to bee to us. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6, 7. God the Father gave Chriſt the preheminence in all, and above all: Hee preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with his own voice, and bade all men to hear him: He ſet him forth with mighty ſignes and wonders, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and the miniſtration of his Angels, and acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Saints, &amp;c. How highly then ſhould he be prized by us?</p>
            <p n="3">3 It ſhould teach men to ſet a high price upon their own fouls. You ſee that when they are in Captivity and ſlavery to Satan, and in a loſt eſtate, there is nothing in the World, no not all the World, with all its worth, can redeem them; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the propitiation of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. When God gave <hi>Egypt</hi> for his peoples ranſome, and <hi>Aethiopia</hi> and <hi>Seba</hi> for them, hee ſhewed that hee prized them at a high rate. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.3, 4. But all the Kingdomes of the world are baſe and vile, if compared with the foul of man. God ſet that at the price of his Sons blood: and Chriſt did ſo eſteem it that hee gave his life for it. Should it not then bee highly valued of <hi>us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 As God the father ſet forth this Chriſt to <hi>us,</hi> ſo let us ſet forth this Chriſt as a propitiation to <hi>God</hi> the father. When wee apprehend God to bee diſpleaſed and angry with us: wee may humbly go to him, and ſay, <hi>Lord, thou haſt before all time ſet a part, and ever ſince time began, ſet forth, thy Son Jeſus Chriſt to bee a propitiation for ſinners. Now thus thou haſt imboldened us to ſet forth the ſame Jeſus Chriſt to be our Propitiation to thee. Thou haſt ſealed him to bee ſuch, and now thou canſt not deny thy own hand and ſeal. Joh.</hi> 6.27. Wee are fure that <hi>Chriſt is an offering and ſacrifice of ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto God.</hi> Eph. 5.2. How unſavory ſo ere that wee are, or have been. And if wee pay God in his own coin, that will bee current with him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Set forth Chriſts propitiation to others: every one to your reſpective relations. As the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. laſt. <hi>He is altogether lovely, Loe this is my beloved: and this my Friend, &amp;c.</hi> Inform the ignorant, convince the erroneous, aſhame the voluptuous, and contemners of Chriſt, out of that fooliſh choice which they have made, of other lovers inſtead of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:168555:65"/>him. Draw all that you may; that they may forſake all other beſides, that <hi>they may go and ſeek him with you,</hi> as chap. 6.1.</p>

            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>That the Satisfaction of Chriſt is effectual to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of a Sinner through Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſts blood juſtifieth through faith.</note> Or, That it is through the grace of Faith, that the bleſſing of Juſtification is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conveyed.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:168555:65"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> Our juſtification by Faith without the works of the Law. Which hee proves by the impoſſibility of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by works, by the Teſtimony of <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> and by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.9, 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. &amp;c. in diverſe places plentifully inſiſted on.</p>
            <p>Now for the better underſtanding of this truth, it will bee needful to Anſwer a few queſtions.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>How</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> James <hi>are reconciled?</hi>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>In what ſenſe is it that through Faith a Sinner is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For Anſwer,
<note place="margin">In what ſenſe faith juſtifieth.</note> I ſhall ſhew firſt in what ſenſe it doth not juſtify, then how it doth.</p>
            <p n="1">1 A Sinner is not juſtified by Faith, as it is a <hi>vertue or work in us:</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle doth exclude all works as ſuch, from Juſtification, and Faith and works are oppoſed: <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. Beſides, if it hath its place in juſtification as a work; it cannot ſtand with the free grace of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. for grace and works are ſtill oppoſed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5, 6. Further, that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs by which a ſinner is juſtified muſt be exact and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but our faith is imperfect, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Faith doth not juſtify as if the very act of beleeving were the matter of righteouſneſſe, or any part thereof by which wee ſtand righteous before God. This appears, in that the righteouſneſs by which wee are juſtified is not our own: <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. but our faith is our own (though wrought in us by the Spirit of God) <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. and by theſe two Anſwers wee oppoſe two errours, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Papiſts and <hi>Arminians,</hi> who wickedly rob Jeſus Chriſt of his honour, and make an Idol of faith: whereas wee are juſtified by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9. verſ. 19. <hi>by the obedience of one,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Faith doth onely juſtify us <hi>relatively,</hi> or as it hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to its object Jeſus Chriſt, and his righteouſneſs. As the hand of a beggar receiving a bag of Gold beſtowed upon him, inriches him. Now its not the hand properly, but it is the bag of gold freely beſtowed that makes a beggar rich: So the hand of the woman that touched our Saviour Chriſt heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her: not as it was a hand, but as it conveyed the vertue
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:168555:66"/>that came out of Jeſus Chriſt; So a mans faith is ſaid to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify him; becauſe it receiveth Chriſt, or the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and indeed whatſoever is done by faith is done by Chriſt, and therefore our being ſaid to bee juſtified by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. is our being juſtified by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But here is a great Queſtion, <hi>How can it bee ſaid, that Faith can juſtify, ſo much as instrumentally; ſeeing that an Inſtrument is a cauſe; how then can wee have any hand as cauſes in our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Juſtification taken actively and paſſively.</note> Wee are to know that Juſtification is taken two waies. 1 <hi>Actively.</hi> 2 <hi>Paſſively.</hi> The active Juſtification is, that whereby God the Father juſtifies a ſinner, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth him juſt for the ſake of the imputed righteouſneſs of Chriſt. In this ſenſe faith is no cauſe; nor hath any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at all into a ſinners juſtification; but Juſtification <hi>taken paſſively,</hi> is that whereby beleevers by faith (as by an hand) do receive, apprehend, and apply to themſelves the merits of Chriſts death: and in this ſenſe faith is an inſtrumental cauſe, <hi>viz. A paſſive Inſtrument;</hi> and cannot bee denyed its place in, and influence into a ſinners juſtification.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 Becauſe by Faith is our union with Chriſt, and our ingrafting into him: and juſtification is a ſpecial privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and benefit, properly ariſing from our union with Chriſt; And then is the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs to us, (according to the Goſpel dialect) when it is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith; and hence juſtification is ſet after vocation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. and therefore after faith; becauſe faith is wrought in vocation.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The proper nature and office of faith is to <hi>rely</hi> and <hi>reſt</hi> on Chriſt, or the grace of God in Chriſt, for Righteouſneſs and Salvation; hence the phraſes of <hi>reſting, beleeving, leaning on him,</hi> as on the Rock, the Corner ſtone, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3, 4. and other places. Faith makes it, its proper diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing action, to look out for a righteouſneſs, for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and finding it in Chriſt, wholly reſts and relies on it; as the Rock and Foundation, the poor Sinner muſt be ſtayed by and built upon.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Faith makes a ſpecial uſe of all the Promiſes: draws water out of thoſe wells: receives and imbraces all the good things held forth in them: but eſpecially imbraceth remiſſion of ſins, as one of the higheſt and chiefeſt Goſpel concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which hee hath to appropriate and improve to his greateſt comfort; and the foundation for to build on and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe all other graces and duties, and thence <hi>the juſt is ſaid to live by faith,</hi> Hab. 2.4.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Becauſe faith is conſtituted, and ordained of God in the Covenant of grace, as a neceſſary and indiſpenſible means for attainment of this end in <hi>adult</hi> perſons. He did from
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:168555:67"/>eternity pitch on the grace of faith above all other; for the applying the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt unto the ſoul of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Becauſe faith gives more glory to God and Chriſt, than any other grace: having <hi>free grace</hi> for its ſupport, and in a ſpecial manner <hi>free grace in Juſtification;</hi> and going out of, and denying it ſelf more than any other grace; receiving all from, and attributing all to Chriſt and his fulneſſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16. and moſt eſpecially whatever it hath, or expecteth for juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Which makes the Apoſtle ſpeak as hee doth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. and every true beleever with him, <hi>by grace we are ſaved through faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. This Doctrin doth clearly diſcover the dangerous eſtate of <hi>unbeleevers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The danger of unbeleevers.</note> above all others: there being no other way to receive that grace that is offered unto us in Chriſt; or to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto the comfort of it. Heb. 11.6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God;</hi> and what comfort or ſupport can that man have who is not pleaſing unto God? There is but one Ark in all the World to ſave a poor ſinner from the deluge of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that is, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and no getting into this Ark but by faith. There is death all the World over but in Chriſt. As it was in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> &amp;c. So ſhall the comming of the Son of man bee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.38, 39. how many on the face of the earth, ſhall the ſecond deluge, or overwhelming deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction finde, out of Chriſt, the only Ark for poor ſinners to bee ſaved by? When the flood came, the world knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>i. e.</hi> beleeved nothing, and therefore rejected and deſpiſed the Ark that was preparing: Oh! unbeleef is a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damning ſin, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8, 9. eſpecially in thoſe that live under the clear diſpenſation of the Goſpel. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.15, 16. It was for this ſin the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>broken</hi> off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. even the whole body of the Nation; and have been ever ſince the moſt accurſed people in all the world. Mark it all yee unbeleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, your curſe is doubled, and your Condemnation is, <hi>The Condemnation, Joh.</hi> 3.19. The Law pronounceth a curſe for the breaking of it: but the Goſpel a far greater, for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt, and your Life, and Salvation, which is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto you through him. A Malefactor dies by the Law, juſtly, becauſe by his wickedneſs hee hath deſerved it: but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:168555:67"/>if hee hath an offer of a pardon, and refuſeth it, hee is doubly guilty of his own deſtruction. And this is the miſery of poor unbeleevers, in the daies of the Goſpel. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18.36.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Why do you tell us of the danger of unbeleef, which are not Infidels but (hriſtians? Anſ.</hi> Innumerable multitudes of ſouls do periſh, like the herd of Swine in the Sea, that are driven head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to deſtruction by Saran, upon this conceipt, that they are in the faith, when they are not. Therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Let this teach us to examine and try our ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee are in the faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. ſeeing we are juſtified by Faith. Say thus, have I gotten this precious grace? <hi>viz.</hi> faith in Chriſts blood, yea or not? and bee not haſty in concluding that thou haſt it. And for the diſcovery of this, whether thou art in the faith, conſider theſe trials, 1 more general. 2 more particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1 More general, Conſider, Firſt,
<note place="margin">Tryals of faith</note> whether thou haſt a lower work of faith, which although it doth not juſtify, yet it is a ſtep unto the other, <hi>viz.</hi> to beleeve the truth of <hi>all the things that are written in the Law and the Prophets, Act.</hi> 24.14. It thou haſt not a dogmatical faith of theſe, thou art worſe than the Devils: and if thou beleeveſt them, but as the Devils, thou ſhalt have no more benefit by thy ſaith, than the Devils have. But if this faith have a tendency to juſtifying Faith, it is of pretious uſe to thee, and cauſeth thee, as it did <hi>Paul,</hi> to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thy ſelf, to have a Conſcience void of offence, toward God and man, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. This is known very much by your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving the Commandements, as well as the Promiſes: but ſee, do you beleeve the Commandements? hee that beleeves them will ſet upon the obeying of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. yea, he will have reſpect to every Commandement: do you beleeve the threatnings? Sure then you will tremble at them. So <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2, 5. As when wee ſee a Childe ſhooting at us; wee fear not his arrows, not will ſtir for him, becauſe we beleeve not that hee can, or will hurt us. But if we ſee a skilful archer to level at us, wee will not dare to ſtand within bow-ſhot, becauſe wee beleeve hee will hit us. So 'tis in apprehending Gods threatnings againſt our ſins. When he ſhoots his arrows at us, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 45.5. certainly, if a man beleeves not Commands and Threatnings, hee beleeves not with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:168555:68"/>faith. Yea, ſee how thou likeſt the faithful applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word to thy conſcience: eſpecially when it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial. A naughty unbeleeving heart will turn from it; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. at the leaſt hee doth not love to apply it to himſelf for his profit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. and ſuch a hearer may ſit under the means all his life time, and never bee the better.</p>
            <p n="2">2 See whether thy faith bee a working faith. By this thou ſhalt know whether it bee the work of God; if it act vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly againſt the allowance of any ſin: that Faith which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth dead and idle, is like a dead and unſavory carcaſs in Gods accompt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.22, 24. that <hi>Faith</hi> that <hi>works</hi> not <hi>by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Mark 1.15. that <hi>works</hi> not <hi>by love, Gal.</hi> 5.6. that <hi>brings not forth good fruits,</hi> that bauks any duty, and imboldens to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sin, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.1, 2. it is not hard for him that ſhall deſcend into his own conſcience, to diſcern what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of faith hee hath attained unto.</p>
            <p n="3">3 See whether your faith bee any other than what you have by <hi>natural power and abilities</hi> attained unto: hee that hath no other, hath not this ſaving faith wrought in him: for this is wrought by a divine ſupernatural power, Matth. 16.17. <hi>fleſh and blood hath not revealed it,</hi> Col. 2.12. <hi>Faith of the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, Eph.</hi> 1.19. It is true, a carnal man may do many duties required of him in the moral Law (for the outward performance) becauſe hee hath the ſeeds of the Law left in him; but ſaving faith muſt bee created and wrought onely by the power of God; which ſhews that the faith of ſome is but a meer fancy: ſeeing they have no more than meer nature in them, there was never any difficulty in the attainment of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It is a grace that is not wrought in the heart, unleſs <hi>ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly humbled:</hi> Neither will ever abide in a proud heart: how can you beleeve? &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.44. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.4. See how the Lord brought down <hi>Paul</hi> and the Jaylor, and thoſe <hi>Act.</hi> 2. So that until Pride, and Self conceitedneſs, and Vain-glory, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of others bee removed: yea, all glorying in, and boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our own righteouſneſſe; And unleſſe the heart bee brought to ſome conſtant frame of humility, it neither will or can beleeve. And the want of this is the cauſe why ſo many Profeſſors turn to errours and prophaneneſs, and a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:168555:68"/>looſe kinde of life: it comes from the <hi>unbrokenneſs</hi> and <hi>unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medneſs</hi> of their hearts. Now Faith of all other graces is a heart-breaking and ſoul-humbling grace.</p>
            <p>More particularly, There are divers degrees and meaſures of faith. And wee muſt take heed that wee do not lay ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks before the eies of weak beleevers, by ſetting down ſuch trials of faith as belong onely to ſtrong beleevers: Such as <hi>Abraham, Moſes, Job,</hi> &amp;c. When as weak ones cannot finde them in themſelves, they diſquiet themſelves without juſt cauſe. For clearing of which, conſider ſome ſigns of the weakeſt faith, out of <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.24. where you ſhall find an example in the poor man that brought his Son to our Saviour Chriſt to bee healed, and made profeſſion of his Faith, in which wee may obſerve theſe particulars.
<note place="margin">Signs of the weakeſt faith.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 There is a <hi>ſound Conviction</hi> of his unbeleef: hee perceives what an unbeleeving heart hee had; and this is the firſt work of <hi>the Spirit of God, Joh.</hi> 16.8. and a work perceiveable by the weakeſt beleever: now none can convince the ſoul of its unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef, but the Spirit of God; and this is ſuch a conviction as cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſinner not onely to ſee but to <hi>mourn</hi> for his unbeleef be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, to pray and ſtrive earneſtly againſt it. He ſaid <hi>with Tears—Lord help my unbeleef;</hi> hee therefore that is not ſenſible of this ſin on the like manner, hath not ſo much as a weak faith wrought in his heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is a <hi>ſtrong deſire</hi> after faith, and grace, and Chriſt. So there was in this poor beleever. It is ordinary in the Scripture to expreſſe the nature of the weakeſt faith by <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt,</hi> as <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37, 38. now that ſignifies a reſtleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after Chriſt and Grace, accompanied alwaies with ſtrong indeavours in the uſe of the means to attain unto the things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. It is not a <hi>lazy</hi> and <hi>liſtleſs deſire,</hi> ſuch as <hi>the Sluggard</hi> hath <hi>which kills him:</hi> but ſuch as ſets the heart and outward man on work to attend diligently on the means of grace to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto faith in Chriſt, and that in a greater meaſure. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let <hi>lubberly</hi> and <hi>lazy</hi> Profeſſors take notice of this, that they have no true faith in their hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In this beleever, there was a <hi>holy jealouſy</hi> that hee might not bee deceived about his grace, that made him ſo to complain. A weak beleever deals like a wiſe man, that is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:168555:69"/>but a young beginner, and newly ſet up in his trade, hee fears exceedingly leſt hee ſhould bee deceived with counterfeit wares, or copper mony: ſo it is with a provident Chriſtian: hee is very circumſpect and wary leſt hee ſhould bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with <hi>Copper and Alchymy faith.</hi> Therefore hee loves a faithful and ſearching Miniſtry, that will gage his heart, and diſcover the unſoundneſs of it, Joh. 3.21. <hi>Hee comes to the light that his deeds may bee made manifest,</hi> &amp;c. whereas a falſe heart is ever joyned with a great deal of Carnal confidence, will not bee beaten off but that all is well and ſound with him; hee will not indure the weight of a faithful Miniſtry, nor abide the light of it, it dazles his eyes. It breeds much peace to him, to ſay, <hi>That Preaching is for mony, and Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are deceivers,</hi> and ſo deſpiſeth the Miniſtry and Word too.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The poor beleever <hi>offers</hi> himſelf to the good <hi>will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Chriſt,</hi> inquiring into it, with reſolution to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lord requires of him. So it was wont to bee in young converts, as in <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 9.6. who ſaid, <hi>Lord what wouldest thou have mee to do?</hi> He means, that he would do any thing that the Lord ſhould appoint him: So it was <hi>Act.</hi> 12.37. and <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30. where there are the like Examples; as they are not afraid to <hi>ſhame</hi> themſelves for ſins paſt; ſo their hearts are fixed for the future, to imbrace in judgement and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice every duty commanded. Let the falſe heart come to this touchſtone, and hee will appear counterfeit. Oh! how will hee cavil againſt any ſtrickt truth? hee will never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that men are bound to ſuch preciſeneſſe; to ſanctify the Sabbath, to dayly family-duties, and ſecret prayer, or to reſtitution in caſe of theft or couzenage, and doth wittingly, and willingly reject all the word that agrees not with his own judgement and fancies.</p>
            <p n="5">5 The weakeſt faith <hi>purgeth the heart</hi> from the love and allowance of every <hi>known ſin, Act.</hi> 15.9. and works inward ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in the beginnings of it, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. Indeed there are ſome common gifts of ſanctification in Temporaries and ſuch as after become Apoſtates, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. but their hearts were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truely broken off from Sin.
<note place="margin">Comfort.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. It is comfort to every true beleever, that juſtification
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:168555:69"/>is by faith, and unſpeakeable ground of rejoycing to him, that there is ſo great a bleſſedneſſe beſtowed upon a poor ſinner. Such an one as comes abſolutely from <hi>Election,</hi> and tendes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to <hi>Salvation. Rom.</hi> 4.6. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3. yea, what a removal is there of the great fears and terrours of the Almighties wrath and diſpleaſure; Know therefore, all you poor beleevers, that your <hi>perſons</hi> are juſtified, and your <hi>ſervices accepted</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus; and nothing for <hi>condemnation</hi> can be ever charged upon you. So that I may ſay with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>Bee glad in the Lord, and rejoyce ye juſt, and ſhout for joy all ye that are upright in heart.</hi> Pſal. 32.11.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>What need we to comfort beleevers, cannot they take their comforts eaſily enough home to themſelves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Preſumption wants no comfort, it will ſoon catch at that which doth not belong to it: but beleevers indeed (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially weakones) have great need of comfort. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, &amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 4.01. he means that his people have great need of conſolation in this point. Remember how it was with <hi>Job</hi> himſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 9.16. though hee had <hi>called,</hi> and God had anſwered him, yet he would not beleeve that God had hearkened to his voice. And <hi>David</hi> too, though <hi>Nathan</hi> had told him, that the Lord <hi>had put away his ſin, that hee ſhould not dye,</hi> yet how earneſt was he (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.) for <hi>pardon?</hi> which ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals beleevers, not only upon their <hi>relapſes,</hi> but even upon their <hi>upright walking</hi> before God, and God will make them to know, that not onely Faith and Juſtification, but alſo the <hi>comfort</hi> of a juſtified eſtate, is the free gift of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. and they ſhall finde it true, that although it bee eaſy for nature to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to juſtification by works; yet it is hard to cloſe with mercy in a way of free grace. The conſolation therefore will be very great to them in theſe two particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is a <hi>Comfort in the poor ſervices</hi> they do,
<note place="margin">Comforts.</note> and <hi>the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of their duties. And this is one of Satans ſtrong Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, whereby hee ſeeks to trouble their peace; hee firſt tempts to ſet light by Chriſt, and his righteouſneſſe; and to ſeek juſtification by our <hi>own works;</hi> and then hee will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us with the <hi>many fallings</hi> of our duties and performances. Thou heareſt ſo unprofitably, and prayeſt ſo deadly and poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and art ſo pinching in good works, that thou canſt not be
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:168555:70"/>juſtified. But beloved, Beware that you hang not your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts upon your duties, but on Chriſt reneived by faith; as the Publican, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. yea the <hi>Gentiles that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed not after righteouſneſs</hi> (viz. of their own) <hi>have attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to righteouſneſs, even that which is of Faith.</hi> This therefore is a beleevers comfort, in all his imperfect and weak perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, that theſe are not his righteouſneſſe wherby he expects to be juſtified: but the righteouſneſs of Chriſt moſt <hi>spotleſs</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> is that which hee builds upon.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But are not good works required of juſtified perſons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, as the <hi>fruits</hi> of faith and juſtification: but not as the merit of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>&amp; Tit.</hi> 3.7, 8. when hee ſaith wee are juſtified by Grace, hee moreover addes: <hi>That it is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying, and theſe things I will that ye affirm conſtantly, that they who have beleeved in God, might bee careful to maintain good works.</hi> Neither is that obedience that is required of Beleevers, a ſtrict and exact conformity to the Law, as it doth in it ſelf require and demand: as Legal obedience, but Evangelical obedience, which ſtands in the deſire, reſolution, and indeavour, to obey Gods revealed will.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If wee were juſtified by Faith, then it is not the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of faith that juſtifieth the Beleever, or <hi>aſſurance:</hi> but it is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his faith, if it bee <hi>true,</hi> though it bee <hi>weak;</hi> that which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles many a beleever, is that hee wants aſſurance, and ſome evident feeling of Gods mercy, or ſight of it, now faith is oppoſed to ſo a <hi>clear a ſight,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. <hi>and is the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. Excellent is that, Joh. 3.14, 15. <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent, &amp;c.</hi> where faith is compared to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> eye, now it was not the ſtrong ſight of the Braſs that healed them; but the weakeſt would do it. So it is with Faith, and therfore though Chriſtians ſhould labour for ſtrong Faith. yet let them not bee diſcouraged at the weakneſs of their faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. Exhortation and Direction to all ſorts of perſons to attain unto, and maintain this grace of faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1 To unjuſtifyed perſons: thoſe that have not faith to make it their main-task, and daily buſineſs, and to imploy the ſtrength of all their indeavours to obtain Faith and Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby. Reconciliation is of wonderful worth. It is true, wee ought to incourage poor ſinners when they begin to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:168555:70"/>reform their lives, and leave their baſe courſes, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Scorning, &amp;c. when theſe become like hot Iron, and ſcalding Lead in their fingers, it is ſome beginning of mercy, to ſuch a ſoul, and it is a farther degree when they come to <hi>do juſtly, and to love mercy,</hi> and live peaceably; for God requires theſe, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8. but it is a grievous deluſion to think that by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch things, wee can finde acceptation, or bee juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. No, no, let a man accompt all the daies of his life that hee hath ſpent, and all the duties that hee hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſpilt and loſt without Faith. Chriſt will tell you, this is the <hi>work of God, that yee beleeve, &amp;c.</hi> Joh. 6.28, 29. it is called a work, becauſe a work of Gods power and working, and a work that hee delights in, wee ſhould bee exerciſed in, to take our farewel of the World, renounce our ſelves, and to fly to Chriſt for refuge from the ſtorm of Gods wrath and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and to prefer him before all, this is the work of faith, that takes us off from all our reſting on our works; and brings us naked unto Chriſt. All other duties are very good in their ſeaſon and kinde, but like <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren, none welcome without a <hi>Benjamin.</hi> No works welcome, and pleaſing to God, without <hi>faith which brings Chriſt.</hi> God ſaith, without <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſee not my face; he would have us <hi>put on</hi> all Chriſtian gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: <hi>the whole Armour of God.</hi> Eph. 6.16. <hi>But above all take the ſhield of Faith.</hi> Becauſe this plece of armour hath a ſingular excellency in it above all other, becauſe it defends all the reſt: the breaſtplate of Righteouſneſs is excellent to keep the <hi>heart,</hi> and the helmet of hope to keep the <hi>head:</hi> but faith muſt keep <hi>both.</hi> As a broad Shield that quencheth Satans fiery darts at whatever part they bee ſhot; and the truth is, there is no grace, Satan ſo much ſhoots at, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. for hereby hee knows wee ſtill prevail againſt him; therefore this is a weapon not only by which wee are ſaid to overcome, but the victory it ſelf, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.4, 5. it cannot bee ſaid ſo of any other weapon; therefore above all put on this.</p>
            <p>Now for the attaining of this grace we muſt know, and be convinced,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That wee have it <hi>not by nature. In the fleſh there dwelleth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. and this is a work of the Spirit, to convince the World of ſin, becauſe it beleeves not, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:168555:71"/>8. and till the heart bee convinced thus, a farther work can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.53.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Bee fully convinced that it is the <hi>Lord onely</hi> that <hi>muſt work</hi> it, he muſt <hi>draw</hi> us, or elſe we will not, or can not come to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Bee convinced of our great unworthineſſe that he ſhould beſtow it upon us, becauſe of our frequent ſleighting of Chriſt, and <hi>Gadaren-like</hi> refuſal of him, preferring our Swiniſh luſts before him; God gives faith where it may be to the glory of his grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 6.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Know, that beleeving, is receiving of Chriſt in all his <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> and giving up our ſelves unto his diſpoſal, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Know what a dangerous thing it is to bee <hi>mistaken in this</hi> Faith, there bee many things which the Devil and the World call faith, which are not ſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22.</p>
            <p n="6">6 That there is no Chriſt to be received by faith, but only <hi>in and by the Promiſes of the Gospel,</hi> Act. 15.7. he ſaith, the Gentiles ſhould hear the Word of Gods Goſpel and beleeve. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. Oh make much of Promiſes, ſearch them, hide them in your hearts, look for Chriſt in them, think much on them, and turn them into Prayers, this it may bee will bee meant by the hiding the <hi>treaſure, Mat.</hi> 13.44, 45.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Bee perſwaded that the Promiſe <hi>carrieth Chriſt</hi> when the Spirit of God ſpreads it, and applies it, and works with it in the publick Miniſtry. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Otherwiſe it may bee ſaid, why may I not bee contented with reading at home? but know that the Miniſtry is the <hi>Miniſtry of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and the Spirit works in it. Hence Miniſters are ſaid to <hi>juſtify</hi> their hearers, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But will any conviction ſerve to work faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Spirits</hi> conviction goeth farther than any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8, 10. that will reach to the heart, for it is <hi>unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.5. <hi>Our Gospel came not unto you in word only, &amp;c.</hi> this Spirit of Illumination is ſtrong, for it ſubdues all, and transforms all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. Oh then bee inſtant, conſtant, and fervent in prayer for this good Spirit of his: for it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that ask it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhut up this uſe, for the attaining this pretious grace, I ſhall commend to you the conſideration of one place; it is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:168555:71"/>of <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11, 12. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Bereans were more noble (or</hi> better diſpoſed) <hi>than they of.</hi> Theſſalonica, <hi>in that they received the word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily whether thoſe things were ſo, therefore many of them beleeved.</hi> Where obſerve how the <hi>Bereans</hi> attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1 They attended carefully on the publick Miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They did this with <hi>all readineſs of mind,</hi> though (they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jews) <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrin was contrary to them, yet they laid aſide all prejudice againſt it, and heard with <hi>readineſs.</hi> It is a great matter to have a minde to the Goſpel, this was their better diſpoſition.</p>
            <p n="3">3 They were not contented with the publike Miniſtry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but in private they <hi>ſearched the Scriptures daily,</hi> they did not onely now and then repeat Sermons, but made it their work daily to ſearch the Scriptures; and that <hi>judiciouſly</hi> and with <hi>conſideration.</hi> Neither was it any diſparagement to <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtry to bee tryed by them, but an honour to it, and credit to bee found to bee exact according to the Scriptures. And it is not the leaſt part of Chriſtian Wiſdome to be often trying of, and ſetting home upon his heart a profitable truth, till hee hath fixed it there, and driven the nail to the head.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It follows [many of them beleeved] not a few, but <hi>many,</hi> and <hi>therefore they beleeved;</hi> God gave this great bleſſing to their diligent attention and frequent ſearch of the Scripture, ſo that many <hi>beleeved both of men and women.</hi> And ſure if any of us do the like, wee ſhall ſpeed as they did.</p>
            <p>It is to perſwade and exhort beleevers ſtill to <hi>keep on</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of faith to <hi>maintain</hi> this good eſtate of Juſtification.
<note place="margin">Exhort. 2. To beleevers.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Faith is of conſtant uſe, for their <hi>continued Juſtification,</hi> and the <hi>comfort</hi> of that eſtate, Gal. 2.16. <hi>Even wee have beleeved in Chriſt Jeſus, that wee might bee (ſtill) juſtified by the faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> It is obſervable that is ſpoken of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 15.6. <hi>that hee beleeved God, and it was accounted to him for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> though doubtleſs hee beleeved before upon the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of his own Country, but at this time hee is ſaid to be juſtified by faith: becauſe the Holy Ghoſt would give a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Teſtimony to his faith at this time, for his own, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:168555:72"/>our comfort; When God made him a Promiſe of ſeed, when <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> were both very aged: and ſo an unlikely thing, had he not <hi>beleeved God who promiſed.</hi> Faith therfore juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies at all times, it is not only a <hi>boat</hi> or <hi>bridge</hi> to carry us into a ſtate of Juſtification: but it is as our <hi>leggs to walk with God</hi> in a juſtified ſtate at all times, and hence it is put as the condition of the Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.1. for faith is that whereby wee <hi>walk before God, and are perfect</hi> in Chriſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But what need wee trouble our ſelves any more about our Juſtification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing that once juſtified, wee are for ever juſtified?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is neceſſary for divers weighty reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Though a juſtified eſtate bee a ſure eſtate; yet the <hi>ſureneſs</hi> of it depends (under God) upon <hi>faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Wee are kept by the power of God through Faith</hi>— it is true, God can keep us by his abſolute power without faith; but his <hi>ordinate</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly power,</hi> is through a <hi>lively and active</hi> faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is a duty that God requires of us to bee careful to <hi>continue</hi> in a juſtified eſtate. Rev. 22.11. <hi>Hee that is righteous, let him bee ſo ſtill.</hi> The word ſignifies let him bee <hi>juſtified</hi> ſtill: or let him go on, and continue in a juſtified eſtate, and Heb. 3.6, 14. <hi>whoſe houſe wee are, if wee hold faſt the confidence and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of our hope,</hi> verſ. 14. Wee are partakers of Chriſt, if wee hold the beginning of our confidence, the word tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted confidence <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſignifies <hi>ſubſiſtence,</hi> or <hi>ſtanding faſt to the end,</hi> againſt all aſſaults: wee cannot plead <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> for our outward man without faith; but this is of a higher nature: we cannot <hi>ſubſist to God-ward</hi> without holding faſt the grace of faith, and uſe it, and that ſtedfaſtly to the end.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is requiſite for the increaſe and farther <hi>growth</hi> of our faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17. in the Goſpel is revealed the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God <hi>from faith to faith,</hi> i. e. our righteouſneſſe for Juſtification, is revealed that wee ſhould proceed from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of faith to another; and this is the way to a full aſſurance. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11, 12. wee deſire that every one of you give <hi>the ſame diligence to the full aſſurance of hope.</hi> It is much to bee lamented, that ancient beleevers after a long profeſſion are much to ſeek in this; and are ſtill queſtioning their title to Chriſt: there are two ſpecial reaſons of it, 1 Their <hi>neglect</hi> of their <hi>watch,</hi> and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:168555:72"/>their frequent <hi>back-ſlidings</hi> into their ſins. See 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> The neglect of the <hi>improving</hi> their faith upon all occaſions; they cannot get aſſurance without this.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It is requiſite for Chriſtians <hi>ſafety and comfort</hi> in life and death: if wee improve our faith in our Juſtification, wee ſhall improve our ioy and comfort alſo; and keep an even current, without ſo much <hi>ebbing</hi> and <hi>flowing, clouds</hi> and <hi>ecclipſes,</hi> and in ſtorms and dangers, it will keep a Chriſtian on the main, where he ſhall have <hi>See-room</hi> enough; and as they did in their ſtorms, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.28. <hi>once they ſounded, and found it twenty fathoms, again they ſounded and found it fifteen, and lest they ſhould fall on the Rocks, they caſt out four Anchors.</hi> So ſhould Chriſtians do, I mean not content themſelves that they are <hi>lanched</hi> forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtream of Gods Mercy; but ſhould bee often <hi>ſpunding</hi> in the <hi>ſurvey</hi> of their ſpiritual comforts. And when they finde them to grow ſhallow, and to leſſen, it is dangerous to go ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely on: there bee rocks or ſands neer, it is good to have your Anchors of faith and hope in a readineſs; yea, to caſt them <hi>within the veil,</hi> to prevent ſuch dangers and deſperate evils as are approaching.</p>

               <hi>hath eſpecially Jeſus Chriſt, or the mercy of God in Chriſt, for its object.</hi> It is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, that <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>juſtifier of him that beleeveth in Jeſus;</hi> i. e. to renounce all other things for Juſtification, and relye only on Jeſus Chriſt, and his righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Juſtifying faith may be conſidered two ways: 1 Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>general object and action</hi> of it, which is to embrace the whole Word of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.22. it receives the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, beleeves the Threatnings, reſpects the Promiſes, it receives the good things promiſed, it is a guide to all our actions, the fountain of all our obedience, it is alſo exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about all the Attributes, and Works of God; about the Immortality of the Soul, the Reſurrection of the Body, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:168555:73"/>the laſt Judgement. But in none of theſe ſenſes it doth juſtifie.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Juſtifying faith is conſidered according to the <hi>eſpecial.</hi> and <hi>moſt eminent effect of it.</hi> Hath Jeſus Chriſt for the object. Acts 16.31. <hi>Beleeve on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Joh. 11.25. <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life, he that beleeveth on me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live.</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever beleeveth on him ſhall not periſh.</hi> Acts 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, that through his name, whoſoever belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth on him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Righteouſneſſe is ſtill tied to faith in Chriſt, who is ſaid to be <hi>the end of the law for righteouſneſſe to every one that beleeveth,</hi> Rom. 10.4. and this is that which he commandeth <hi>to be preached throughout all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Luke 24.47. and this is that the faith of all the Saints hath in a ſpecial manner reſpected and imbraced. It was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16. and the Eunuchs faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.28. and <hi>Martha's</hi> faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.26, 27. <hi>Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.</hi> This is the faith that juſtifieth, and by it <hi>the righteouſneſſe of God is unto all, and upon all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> Rom. 3.22. and hence it is called <hi>the faith of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe it apprehendeth <hi>Chriſt</hi> as its object.</p>
            <p>Now I adde, <hi>the mercy of God in Chriſt,</hi> becauſe faith in this, is all one with faith in Chriſt. So that, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. it is ſaid, <hi>by him</hi> (i.e. Chriſt) <hi>we beleeve in God that raiſed him from the dead.</hi> Chriſt is not the object of faith abſtractly, and nakedly conſidered: but Chriſt with his benefits procured and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him, and promiſed by God the Father. The reaſons of this duty are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe nothing in the world can make us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God, further than it doth lay hold on ſuch a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, as is <hi>perfect and accepted for us</hi> (as ſuch) by God. Nothing will make a poor man rich, further than it doth convey, or impart riches into his poſſeſſion; and all that we can doe by faith to our juſtification, is to receive the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe beſtowed on us, and there is no ſuch perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe that is able to cover our ſhame, as Chriſt's is, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.17.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe juſtification of Sinners doth mainly imply a <hi>freedome,</hi> and diſcharge from the curſe and condemnation of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:168555:74"/>the Law, and a way for the full ſatisfaction of it in order to Sinners pardon and diſcharge, and this is to bee found no where but in Chriſt, <hi>who is the end of the lam for righteouſneſſe,</hi> in his <hi>boing made a curſe for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Unleſſe faith juſtifieth, as it hath a reſpect and relation unto Chriſt as its <hi>object,</hi> it can have no more to doe with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, than any other grace, as Charity, Temperance, &amp;c. but we know that they being works of the Law avail nothing to our juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. but the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of faith above other graces, is to draw vertue from Chriſt for juſtification, and to exerciſe it ſelf on the free grace and mercy of God exhibited in him.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But was not</hi> Abraham's <hi>faith juſtifying, as it beleeved the power of God?</hi> Rom. 4.21, 22. <hi>He beleeved in God who quickneth the dead, and God that had promiſed was able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; therefore it was imputed unto him for righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is true, he beleeved the <hi>power of God,</hi> but that did not juſtifie him: but his beleeving on the <hi>promiſed ſeed,</hi> Gen. 22.18. <hi>He ſaw Christ's day</hi> by faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.56. It is true, the faith of Gods power was a ſtay to him in great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he was expoſed unto: ſo it may be to us, but wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtified by that faith which only beleeves the <hi>power</hi> of God to ſave us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. It ſerves to refute thoſe that deny faith to have ſuch a relation unto Chriſt in juſtification as hath been ſpoken of. Such as ſay, faith doth juſtifie without reference to Chriſt, whereby the form and life of juſtifyng faith is taken away, Chriſt is robbed of his glory, and the Conſciences of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of their comfort and peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. It diſcovers the unjuſtified eſtate of thoſe perſons that doe not caſt anchor here, i. e. <hi>in Chriſt.</hi> A man may have great knowledge, and many gifts, and beleeve too to admiration (as they who had the faith of Miracles in the Primitive times, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22, 23.) and yet be unjuſtified; yea he may beleeve the Articles of Chriſtian religion, ſtudy the Promiſes, and think he doth apply them to himſelf, and yet be unjuſtified. It is the very caſe of the ſeed in the ſtony ground, that received the word with joy, <hi>Math.</hi> 13.20. Why conſider, what is the word, that even a carnal heart may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:168555:74"/>in? it is the <hi>word of promiſe,</hi> and this word a ſtony heart may receive and apply to himſelf, and abide ſtony ſtil; though <hi>Iſrael</hi> had tranſgreſſed the Law, and caſt off the thing that was good, yet he would cry, My God we know thee, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3. So the <hi>Jewes,</hi> Joh. 8.39, 41. and thus many catch at Gods mercy, and ſeem to build upon the Promiſe, and yet periſh everlaſtingly.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But alas, ſhould I not build my ſalvation and juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the promiſes of God, what elſe ſhould I repoſe my conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Promiſes vvill not juſtifie.</note> The Promiſes alone are not ſufficient to bear the weight of a ſinners juſtification and ſalvation; neither doe they doe any thing further than they doe direct unto, exhibit, and beſtow upon us <hi>a ſufficient righteouſneſſe</hi> to ſave us; and this muſt be had in <hi>a perſon,</hi> not in a <hi>promiſe,</hi> or propoſition. As for example, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bit with the fiery Serpents, were not healed with the promiſe, or the light, but the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue drawn from the Brazen <hi>Serpent,</hi> by looking on him. So the promiſe alone will not juſtifie, but only as it diſcovers and exhibits ſuch a perſon, <hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt who puts forth, or is cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with ſuch a righteouſneſſe, which (being ſeen with the eye of faith) puts the ſinner into a ſtate of juſtification. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe all the Promiſes diſcover or exhibit Chriſt, though they are all exhibited in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>In</hi> Chriſt, yea and amen: but <hi>without</hi> Chriſt, neither yea, nor amen, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.

Eph. 1.3. <hi>He bleſſeth us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt,</hi> but we can have none, nor lay claim to any promiſe in the Book of God without him.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The comfort truly is, that there is an exhibition, and holding forth of Chriſt in them to the vileſt ſinners: and whilſt there is life there is hope to get into Chriſt, and get intereſt in the Promiſes, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11. <hi>This is the record that God hath given us life eternal, and it is in his Son.</hi> Hence Chriſt is called <hi>the Covenant,</hi> Iſa. 49.8. becauſe not only his perſon was, and is the main thing in the Covenant, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe all the promiſes in the Covenant are his, and made
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:168555:75"/>to him, and in him, and through him only conveyed to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Thus we ſee what a dangerous thing it is to pitch our faith <hi>firſt,</hi> on any thing but Chriſt: and thence to expect a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified eſtate.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How is faith in Jeſus Chriſt known?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. By the entrance of it, which is ſuch that it <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> the ſinner unto Chriſt, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.11. <hi>Forget thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe,</hi> &amp;c. As it is in perſons marrried, who forget and leave their fathers houſe, and old friends, and ſequeſter themſelves to marriage communion: ſo it is with thoſe that are married to the Lord Jeſus; though they have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in their affections to their old ways, yet by heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the word of Chriſt, they renounce and forget all for Chriſts ſake; <hi>then the King takes pleaſure in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 By the progreſſe of it; as <hi>they have received Jeſus Chriſt the Lord, ſo they walk in him,</hi> Col. 2.6, 7. and are <hi>ſubject to him in every thing,</hi> Epheſ. 5.24. yea they <hi>live by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Inſtruction and exhortation, to ſhew and exhort us whither to goe for juſtification. It is unto Chriſt, and the mercy of God in him. Let the main care and deſire of our ſouls be after the perſon, natures, works, and merits of the Lord Jeſus: and thereby ſhall wee bee poſſeſſed of this great benefit of juſtification through him. Neither is my meaning that we ſhould ſeek to come unto him any other way than by the Word and Promiſes; for if we doe, we can never come <hi>to him,</hi> but meet with Satan as an Angel of light in ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm. But wee muſt bee acquainted with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, yea <hi>ſuch</hi> as doe carry and exhibit Chriſt unto us, and therein cloſe with Chriſt before wee can claim the promiſes of pardon, or of the Spirit; or of any grace or glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mot.</hi> 1. Conſider Chriſt as he ſtands in relation to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> he is 1 No other than <hi>the Son of his love,</hi> Col. 1.13. the Fathers love is infinite to him, and therefore he hath given all things into his hands for our juſtification and ſalvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.35. whatever fruit, or teſtimony of the love of God, the ſoul ſtands in need of, he may be ſure to have it from Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The <hi>Father hath ſealed him,</hi> Joh. 6.27. hee hath not only <hi>deſigned</hi> him, but <hi>ſigned</hi> and <hi>ſealed</hi> him a Commiſſion to be a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:168555:75"/>Mediator: hath ſet his ſtamp upon him, his expreſs Image: in ſo much that hee hath the fathers <hi>broad Seal,</hi> to bee our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation; and it can be had no where elſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Hee is the fathers <hi>Annointed,</hi> who <hi>received the Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure;</hi> qualifying and furniſhing of him, with all ſuch ſufficiencies as were requiſite to his Mediators office; and this unction was with <hi>the Holy Ghoſt and Power,</hi> Act. 10.38. <hi>i.e.</hi> with power to do whatever his office required to be done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mot.</hi> 2 Conſider Chriſt in his perſon, as hee is <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God in our nature: as being man hee is fit to be a propitiatory ſacrifice; and being God is able to vanquiſh all his ſufferings, and to give infinite vertue and value to them. Being man he is <hi>fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone;</hi> and hath a feeling of our infirmities: and being God, hee is able to apply all his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings unto us: that a poor beleever may call him <hi>Ithiel and Ucal, Prov.</hi> 30.1. God with mee, and the ſtrong one.</p>
            <p n="2">2 As hee is a middle Perſon, a Mediatour betwixt God and man, 1 Tim. 2.5, 6. Heb. 8.6. <hi>A Mediatour of a better Covenant, eſtabliſhed on better promiſes;</hi> he is a <hi>daies-man</hi> between God and ſinful man: and one fit to deal with both parties at Variance. And therefore wee need not complain as <hi>Job</hi> doth, Job 9.32, 33. <hi>Hee is not a man, as I am, that I ſhould anſwer him, and wee ſhould come together in Judgement, neither is there any daies man</hi> (or umpire) <hi>between us, that may lay his hand upon us both.</hi> Yea, but <hi>Jobs</hi> redeemer was a fit redeemer and um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire that could lay his hand upon <hi>God,</hi> and take up all matters with him, and lay his hand upon the <hi>ſinner,</hi> and bring him to God again.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Conſider Chriſt in all his <hi>fulneſs and freeneſs</hi> to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate that fulneſs of his. <hi>His fulneſs,</hi> Col. 1.19. <hi>it pleaſed the Father that in him all fulneſs ſhould dwell.</hi> See alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. how free hee is to communicate his fulneſs. Heb. 2.17. <hi>Hee is a merciful and faithful High Prieſt in things pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto God to make attonement,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37, 38. hee makes ſolemn Proclamation of mercy to all commers; and promiſes the Spirit of grace unto them.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Conſider Chriſt as <hi>juſt and a juſtified perſon,</hi> and ſo fitted to purchaſe and procure our juſtification. Truely, if he had not been juſtified, hee could not have juſtified us. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:168555:76"/>hee is ſaid to bee juſtified in the Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> juſtified by his divine nature, whereby hee raiſed up himſelf from the dead. As at his death hee was condemned by all ſorts; ſo at his reſurrection hee was abſolved and juſtified from the ſins of his Elect, imputed unto him; and from all the accuſations of the world, who looked upon him as a grievous malefactour. So that his righteouſneſs, both <hi>perſonal and publike</hi> appeared before all the world; and that God the Father, <hi>was well pleaſed with him, and in him,</hi> with all that ſhall beleeve on him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mot.</hi> 3. Conſider the pretious <hi>excellency</hi> of the grace of Faith. Which appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1 In that it is an <hi>uniting grace.</hi> It tyes and unites the ſoul to Chriſt, and to God in Chriſt. Other graces make the ſoul to bee like to Chriſt, but faith makes the ſoul to <hi>bee one with him, Eph.</hi> 3.17. thy Love, Patience, Humility, Heavenly-mindedneſs, make thee very like to Jeſus Chriſt; but faith makes thee to bee <hi>one with him:</hi> as a member with the head: and that is a greater and better condition (for ought I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) than the ſtate of the Elect Angels. Though they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in glory by Chriſt, yet they are not ſo united to Chriſt as a Beleever is. They are the children of God by <hi>Creation,</hi> but Beleevers by <hi>Adoption:</hi> being united to the natural Son of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This is the grace that <hi>aſſures</hi> us of our eternal Election, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. wee may thence moſt certainly conclude, that <hi>our Names are written in the book of life.</hi> Gods Council concerning our everlaſting eſtate lies hidden in the boſome of God, till ſuch time as hee <hi>commends his love to us</hi> in his Son Jeſus: by working faith in our hearts; this is the <hi>Coppy</hi> of Gods eternal decree, and hath written upon it <hi>[concordat cum originali]</hi> it agrees with the Original. This is the very mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this grace, that God hath ſet his heart upon thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>Now what ever God gives elſe; as Honour, Riches, or Excellent ſpiritual gifts, (without faith) brings but little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: and a man may be a reprobate for all theſe things which fall <hi>alike to the juſt and unjuſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Faith in Chriſt <hi>poſſeſſeth</hi> us of him, and that no other grace will do. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. And hence it is the firſt <hi>quieting-grace</hi> to the ſoul. Iſa. 30.15. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, in returning, and reſt, yee ſhall bee ſaved, in quietneſs and confidence ſhall bee your
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:168555:76"/>ſtrength.</hi> Heb. 4.1, 3. there is a Promiſe made of entering into Gods <hi>Reſt,</hi> and wee enter into it by <hi>Faith, wee who have beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are entered:</hi> woe have this true Sabbath, whereof the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Jews had but the type: wee have the true <hi>Canaan</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by the other: this is the very Harbour of a toſſed and weather-beaten ſoul, As Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi> well expreſſeth it. <hi>Faith is the firſt grace that deſcries land, when the ſoul is in the tempeſt and ſtorm of a troubled Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh Beloved! this is the excellency of faith, that it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovers Land (for wee may bee caſt away for all that) but it carries us ſafe into the harbour; for that is our <hi>entrance into our Reſt,</hi> the landing of the wearied ſoul on Chriſt, its reſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how ſhould I get faith in Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 1 Be very careful to ſtudy <hi>the knowledge</hi> of Chriſt. Yee may bee ſure, you cannot beleeve on him, whom you do not know. This is that which is commended by Chriſt himſelf, as that wherein <hi>life eternal</hi> doth conſiſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. and <hi>Paul (who was rapt into the third heavens)</hi> prefers this before any other knowledge, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. hee calls it the <hi>over-exceeding and ſuper-excellent</hi> knowledge of Chriſt. This is that which acquaints the ſoul with a Phyſitian, a Redeemer, a Saviour, a Propitiation, and whatever God requires for ſatisfaction; or man deſires, or can deſire for perfection.</p>
            <p>Tell a wounded ſpirit, that is full of horror of Conſcience, all the moſt profound and tranſcendent notions, in the whole circle of Learning: they will not a jot refreſh him, or bring him the nearer to heavenly joys. Let him bee acquainted with all the motions of heaven, they cannot bring him to heaven: With all the ſecrets of nature, they cannot bring him out of the dreggs of nature; nor make him a Childe of Grace. This is ſufficiently experienced in the Heathen Philoſophers: who for all their great knowledge were ignorant of God, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the learned <hi>Athenians,</hi> among whom the true God was but an <hi>unknown God, Act.</hi> 17.23. and the reaſon was, becauſe their knowledge was not joyned with the knowledge of Chriſt; There is no other knowledge will juſtify but that, and therefore to ſeek juſtification, or quieting to a troubled ſoul by any other, is but to <hi>spend our mony for that which is not bread,</hi>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:168555:77"/>Iſa. 55. or to go to buy bread with braſs mony, ſuch as is not current coyn in Heaven. Nay, other knowledge is ſo far from bringing peace to a diſquieted ſpirit, that it brings with it tormenting and vexation of ſpirit. Eccl. 1.18. <hi>Hee that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow,</hi> other knowledge may, and will <hi>puff up.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1, 2. but this will humble: humble us in our <hi>own</hi> apprehenſions, but really exalt us. Prov. 4, 8. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt her, and ſhee will exalt thee.</hi> Other Divine knowledge will build well, but the knowledge of Chriſt laies the foundation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. this muſt needs have great ſubſtance and ſtrength that bears up all the weight and bulk of the whole Chriſtian edifice: and let mee ſpeak from my heart to all Students that hear this, that unleſs your main care bee to get this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, you do but build <hi>Babels</hi> and Caſtles in the air: And oh that many would make this their great ſtudy, if they did, there would not be ſo many new waies to heaven, and falſe lights as there are, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19.</p>

               <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Make this thy great <hi>heart deſign</hi> in comming to hear the word Preached, for to get faith: ſeeing it comes by hearing. Reſolve upon that end, and think with thy ſelf, if thou commeſt with any by-ends, the ſearcher of hearts will meet with thee: if thou haſt an Idol in thy heart, thou ſhalt bee anſwered according unto it. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.7. How many come with their Idols? Some to get other knowledge, and not of Chriſt; Some to judge the Miniſter, and to carp at the truths delivered: Some to ſee, and to bee ſeen: and others out of meer formality and cuſtome. But alas! where are they that ſtir up themſelves, to lay hold on Chriſt? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7.</p>

Think it not enough that you are Children of the Covenant, as the Jews were, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.25. but yee muſt become alſo the children of the promiſe; for they only are accounted for the ſeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8.</p>

               <hi>Direct.</hi> 4. Bee very watchful that carnal Objections and Cavils againſt Chriſt, or his heavenly Myſteries or Doctrine, ariſe not in your hearts without checking of them, and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt them. Thou mayeſt as eaſily empty the Ocean with a Cockle ſhell, as meaſure the myſtery of godlineſs with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:168555:77"/>carnal Reaſon. Do not caſt off any truth of Chriſt, becauſe you can ſee no reaſon for it, or cannot underſtand how this or that ſhould bee. Prov. 3.5. <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and lean not on thine own underſtanding. Luther</hi> hath ſuch a ſpeech, <hi>That mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt reaſon is a terrible enemy to faith; and this is the reaſon why many great Scholars are left of God;</hi> And ſo our Saviour ſaith, <hi>I thank thee O Father, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 11.25. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> will ſay, <hi>How can theſe things bee?</hi> Joh. 13.6. and the Philoſophers will ſay of <hi>Paul</hi> (when hee goeth to Preach theſe things) <hi>what will this Babler ſay?</hi> Oh! but remember, God will confound the wiſdome of this World: thou ſhouldeſt rather ſay with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur,</hi> when thou heareſt the Doctrin of Chriſt, <hi>ſurely, I am more brutiſh than any man,</hi> when hee heard of <hi>Ithiel</hi> and <hi>

Look at it as an extream vileneſſe in thine heart, and wily working of Satan, when Chriſt is preached, and the grace of God in Chriſt, if thou canſt go away from the word preached, with an unbeleeving, unmoved heart. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for this two or three places, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.26.31. Chriſt had been preaching of the Father, and of himſelf, and his own death, his miſſion, and Commiſſion, and pleaſing of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and verſ. 30. the text ſaith, <hi>when hee ſpake thoſe words, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beleeved on him;</hi> the Spirit takes ſpecial notice, what words they were, that wrought upon the hearers, <hi>i.e.</hi> Chriſts unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conjunction with the Father, the Sufferings and Croſs of Chriſt, his holy Life and Death; they ſtood out long, but now they yielded.

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 5. It ſerves to teach beleevers a main duty that moſt concerns them to practiſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>go on</hi> in a juſtified eſtate by faith in the Lord Jeſus, or imbracing the mercy of God in Chriſt; and that becauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1 They have the main principle in them to maintain a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified eſtate; which others want, <hi>viz.</hi> juſtifying faith. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.6. Though the well of living waters bee very deep, beleevers have wherewithall to draw out of it. They have a price in their hands to get wiſdome, Chriſt is neer, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13. he is neer who iuſtifieth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.13.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The benefit of juſtification <hi>ſhould</hi> be maintained conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Chriſtians heart, and that lively, and (as far as may bee) without interruption; and though our juſtification bee in it ſelf unchangeable, yet it is changeable in the diverſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it; Our peace and comfort is often ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſubject to darknings; as with <hi>David,</hi> when hee ſaith, <hi>I am caſt out of the ſight of God,</hi> Pſal. 31.22. and cryed, <hi>his bones were broken,</hi> and that <hi>hee lay in the deep:</hi> and therefore that wee may maintain our peace, its worth our while, to take pains in preventing our decaies, and declinings. It is eaſier to preſerve peace and joy, than to recover it out of an afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and dark condition: as its eaſier to maintain health and ſtrength, than to fetch it at deaths door, eaſier to keep the fire burning, than to blow it up out of the ſparks and embers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extinct: Therefore they are no ſmall difficulties that they are brought unto, who let their peace and comforts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and be almoſt extinguiſhed, before they renew them.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Wee muſt bee much in the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of our faith on Chriſt for juſtification. Faith is not onely the breeder, and bringer forth of our joy and comfort: but it is the nurſe and <hi>foſter-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:168555:78"/>of them; cheriſhing and feeding of them till wee come to a full and perfect age in Chriſt, <hi>Jud.</hi> 20. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.25. All fruits the neerer they come to ripeneſs, the ſweeter they bee: and ſo is the fruit of faith, ſweeter in the ear, than in the blade. If a juſtified eſtate bee ſweet at the firſt; it muſt needs bee much ſweeter, as the ſtrength of faith, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al acquaintance with God increaſeth. Faith thus exerciſed, doth theſe things. 1 It conveies the thing that is deſired or ſought. Hence in the Scripture, it is ſo often made the inſtrument of Gods conveyance of all his bleſſings to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.11. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14. the promiſe of the Spirit is received through faith. Remarkable is Chriſts ſaying to the Centurion, <hi>Go thy way, and as thou haſt beleeved, ſo be it done unto thee,</hi> Mat. 8.13. whatever faith laies hold on, it make it its own. 2 Though the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of things beleeved, and of a juſtified eſtate in particular, bee ſometimes delayed; yet it ſupports the heart with patience to wait for it; which made <hi>Hanna</hi> quiet, that ſhee <hi>looked no more ſad,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.10, 18. and this made <hi>Abraham</hi> rejoyce in the aſſured expectation of the promiſed ſeed. 3 Faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed makes the ſoul <hi>quick-ſighted</hi> in apprehending the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſatisfaction in the grace deſired, and expected. It ſets the ſoul, as <hi>Moſes</hi> upon mount <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

So <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi> ſaw the things promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. and was perſwaded of them, imbraced and injoyed them (in a great meaſure) as things preſent.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Exerciſe of faith in Chriſt, and apprehending Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereby, is the fundamental work of faith, and all other works of faith do depend upon it.</p>
            <p>It is very obſervable in the Old Teſtament, that when the Lord would ſtrengthen the faith of his people, to beleeve any particular bleſſings, hee gave them a promiſe of the Meſſiah. So when hee made promiſes of deliverance of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and his people, hee granted this ſign, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall conceive,</hi> Iſa. 7.14. So when hee promiſed the reſtauration of his people out of Captivity, hee promiſes Chriſt, and Juſtification by him: <hi>Behold, I raiſe up to the ſeed of</hi> Jacob <hi>a righteous branch, and in
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:168555:79"/>his daies,</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be ſaved, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall dwell ſafely, and this is the Name whereby hee ſhall bee called,</hi> Jehovah <hi>our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> and this is laid for a ground for the peoples faith to work upon, to cauſe them to beleeve their return out of Captivity. So would wee have our faith ſet on work to act lively in any particular duty, or occaſion? would wee exerciſe it in word, Prayer, Sacraments? the way is to go to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1, 5. <hi>Zach.</hi> 6.12, 13. <hi>Behold, the man whoſe name is the branch, hee ſhall grow up out of his place, and hee ſhall build the Temple of the Lord.</hi> Would wee ſet any graces on work, as <hi>love</hi> to God or Man? Faith muſt work with, or rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it ſelf in it, and ſet it on work. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. Would we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt temptation? <hi>Faith quencheth all the fiery darts of Satan,</hi> Eph. 6.16. and makes us ſtrong in the Lord, and the power of his might. In a word, whatever our eſtate, occaſion, or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is; Faith in Chriſt, and in Juſtification by him, muſt bee ſet on work: and it is like the powring waters on the roots, that will make all grow and bee fruitful.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How may we improve our faith in Christ for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Juſtification?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Beware of thoſe things that <hi>hinder</hi> the exerciſe of faith in Chriſt: ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Unbrokenneſs of heart, Mark.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Act.</hi> 19.9. hardneſſe of heart, hinders faith: often altogether, alwaies in part, as far as it doth prevail. It is with ones faith in this caſe, as with a benummed hand or foot, that cannot work, or walk, for the preſent; Thence then if you will have your faith to <hi>work,</hi> get your heart into a tender and lowly frame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Immoderate Aggravation</hi> of ſin is another let, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the former. Thus it is ſome-times with broken-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sinners: they ſee their ſins, and their multitude, and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſſe; and then they plead their great unworthineſs, and <hi>pore</hi> continually upon their corruptions, ſo much as to put away Chriſt, and the promiſe, and the grace of God from them: and then it is impoſſible to beleeve on Chriſt, or to get peace or comfort of a juſtified eſtate.</p>
            <p>Hee that rakes in a kennel, doth in vain complain of the vile ſavour: So it is with thoſe beleevers, who are too much contemplating on, and aggravating their corruptions. It is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:168555:79"/>true, there muſt bee Humiliation to make us hunger after Chriſt, and receive him on his own terms: but to labour <hi>ſo</hi> for Humiliation, as to knock off our hands from Chriſt, is a great evil, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. you muſt look on your ſins, but withall look on Chriſt: Look on your wounds, but alſo on the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Serpent: Complain with <hi>Jonah</hi> that yee are in the belly of Hell, yet look towards the Holy Temple, <hi>i.e.</hi> Chriſt, Jon. 2.4. <hi>Look unto him who came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt,</hi> Matth. 18.6. <hi>That came to bind up the broken hearted,</hi> Iſa. 61.1, 2. that inviteth the <hi>heavy laden,</hi> Matth. 11.28.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The leaſt allowance or hankering after any known ſin: this makes it impoſſible to beleeve. How can yee beleeve, &amp;c? <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.44. One is Proud, and another Covetous, another mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, another hath an unruly tongue, &amp;c. yet they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain at fits that they cannot beleeve: truely, no marvail, Gal. 2.17. <hi>if while wee hope to bee juſtified by faith, wee our ſelves are found ſinners, is Chriſt therefore the Minister of ſin? far bee it:</hi> why, but ſuch kind of ſinners do make Chriſt the <hi>Miniſter of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beloved, wee come to the Sacraments to get our faith ſtrengthened, but what kinde of faith? it is a holy faith, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. ſuch as purifies the heart, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. and dare wee bring a dirty or impure faith to bee ſtrengthened, or would wee have that confirmed or ſealed, that will not take the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſalvation? beware of the impreſſion of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Another let is, immoderate or diſorderly ſeeking our Peace in our Sanctification. I ſay immoderate, 1 When wee ſeek our comfort altogether in our Mortification, or San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, or make it our <hi>main</hi> ſtay and ſtaff. One builds upon his Love, another in his good works, or duties, and this is the baſis of their peace: but let mee tell you, that theſe fruits are changeable things, often in the wain, and ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, and what will you do then for peace? beſides, you rob Chriſt by this means of the honour of his Propitiation, of his Sacrifice and whole office of mediation; and is this any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than making Chriſt unprofitable and of none effect? <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 4.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is prepoſterous and diſorderly, to look for the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:168555:80"/>fruit, before the tree; to look for our graces, before wee look for Chriſt; or look for children, before marriage with Chriſt. Seeing they all flow from our union with Chriſt, if true, and Evangelical, hence they muſt needs bee but baſtard graces that are found before Chriſt, and will give but little comfort of our good and juſtified eſtate.</p>

Set before you in your meditations the name of the Lord Jeſus, and what is meant by that name, Pſal. 9.10. <hi>They that know thy name will put their truſt in thee.</hi> The names of Chriſt are of his <hi>Perſon, Natures, Offices, Benefits, Attributes;</hi> what condition can any poor creature be in, that cannot find ſomething named in Chriſt, for to help him out of it? Cant. 1.3. <hi>Thy name is an ointment poured forth:</hi> it yeelds a moſt pretious and comfortable ſavour to every one. All the names of Chriſt have great ſweetneſſe in them.

            <p>Beloved, it is another matter than is commonly conceived, to bee contemplating on Chriſt.

Learn wee to uſe our Logick this way, and it will arm us for thoſe combates wee meet withall in dealing with ſin or Satan. For although faiths principles are above reaſon, yet it diſcourſes, argumentations and concluſions are guided by reaſon.</p>
            <p>Reaſon is an <hi>ill Miſtreſs,</hi> but a <hi>good Hand-maid</hi> unto faith: for faith is much ſtrengthened (and the wiſdome of a Chriſtian is exceedingly ſeen in it) by ſuch particular concluſions and conſequences, drawn from the doctrin of Chriſt, nature of God, and the Promiſes, which do overthrow particular carnal reaſonings, cauſing ſecurity, preſumption, fears, doubts, or deſpair: and without doubt this makes greatly for ſecuring the heart, and fortifying our faith and confidence againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptation of Satan; onely let mee adde a Caution or two.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That this bee not a <hi>ſuddain</hi> or <hi>tranſient</hi> buſineſſe, either too ſoon and raſhly to catch up a Concluſion, that is not in the Premiſes: Or when wee have a right concluſion, too ſuddainly to have done with it, but if you will have good by it, it muſt bee permanent, and abiding on the heart, that it may ſoak into it, and ſtrengthen it againſt any malignant diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that it is diſturbed and troubled withall. A good plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will not benefit that is on and off immediately; nor a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion work kindly, that is not kept in the ſtomack: therefore
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:168555:81"/>ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.97, 98. <hi>O how I love thy Law, it is my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation all the day, thou through thy Commandements hast made mee wiſer than mine enemies, for they are ever with mee,</hi> and Pſa. 45.1. <hi>My heart is inditing</hi> (or boiling up) <hi>i. e.</hi> meditating or inventing a good matter, and this requires time for a good concoction.</p>

If wee have the light of Chriſt by faith, it will diſcover all the deluſions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts of darkneſs, that Satan ſeeks to involve our reaſonings in. Therefore let us ſtill have an eye to the <hi>propoſition</hi> of Faith; looking up to the Spirit for aſſiſtance in the improvement of it.</p>

There is beleeving, and knowledge that wee do beleeve true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on Chriſt. Now to know that wee do beleeve, is to know, not ſo much the ſtrength of faith, as the truth of it, how weak ſoever, and true faith is a receiving of whole Chriſt, with the whole heart; &amp; it is oppoſed to a partial or hypocritical recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt; ſuch as is ſpoken of, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.3. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its called <hi>beleeving with all the heart,</hi> Act. 8.37, 38. and hence its called <hi>faith unfeigned.</hi> Now to know this, wee muſt view our own hearts and conſciences, to ſee if they work thus towards Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now if God hath wrought ſuch a Faith in you, you may ſay with <hi>Paul, I know whom I have beleeved;</hi> and this knowledge is a reflex act, and may be helped by theſe two Queſtions.</p>

And this aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Spirit comes from Chriſt, as the light from the Sun, by an <hi>efflux, Joh.</hi> 8.12. the power is in Chriſt, though it work on us. Therefore all things are ſaid to be done <hi>through Chriſt ſtrengthening of us,</hi> Phil. 4.13.

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:168555:82"/>the ſhameful and accurſed death of the croſs. Therefore we obſerve,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>It is the duty of ſinners, for their Juſtification, distinctly to apprehend and rely upon Chriſt crucified;</hi> Or thus, <hi>That it is the Duty, and ſhould bee the care of ſinners, to place their confidence on Chriſt crucified for Juſtification.</hi> For that is the meaning of the phraſe [Faith in his blood] that is, faith relying on Chriſt crucified. This notes the <hi>ſubject matter</hi> of redemption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Faith is principally grounded, in the article of our Juſtification. Our faith indeed in the point of Juſtification doth imbrace <hi>whole Chriſt,</hi> but moſt properly, and in a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar manner, it is terminated in the Sacrifice and Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt: and this the Scriptures atteſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53, 54, 55. Jeſus ſaid unto them, <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you, except you eat the body, of the Son of God, and drink his blood, you have no life in you;</hi> and this is by beleeving on Chriſt crucified (for Chriſt doth not ſpeak there immediately of the Lords Supper, though Sacramental eating may bee comprehended under it) and hee ſaith peremptorily that there is no life; and therefore no juſtification or Salvation without the eating there mentioned, but hee addes on the contrary, verſ. 54. <hi>Who ſo eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood</hi> (by faith) <hi>hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day;</hi> There is a direct pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Life, Juſtification, and Salvation to them that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on Chriſt crucified; and verſ. 56. <hi>Hee that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in mee, and I in him,</hi> i.e. hath union and communion with Chriſt Jeſus, in all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: and therefore muſt needs bee juſtified, and this is the ſame which <hi>John</hi> preached, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. <hi>i.e.</hi> the Lamb of God for <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that wee ſhould behold for juſtification with the eye of faith. Yea, ſo Joh. 3.14, 16. <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, &amp;c.</hi> that <hi>lifting up</hi> was eſpecially when Chriſt was Crucified and lifted up upon the Croſs; and looking on the brazen Serpent ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed beleeving on Chriſt crucified, that ſuch as did ſo <hi>ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life</hi> And this is the very <hi>condition</hi> of the Covenant of grace.</p>

               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Taken from the Old Teſtament, wherein the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Chriſt and Juſtification, was more veiled and dark:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:168555:83"/>yet even then this truth was received, that their reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was by faith in the Meſſiah to come, and made a ſacrifice for ſin; and hence the Covenant was confirmed with <hi>blood ſhed, Heb.</hi> 9.20. neither was the Old Teſtament dedicated without it, Exod. 24.8. For <hi>when</hi> Moſes <hi>had spoken every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, hee took the blood of Calves and Goats, and ſprinkled both the book, and all the people, ſaying, This is the blood of the Teſtament that God enjoyned unto you,</hi> and verſ. 23. <hi>it was neceſſary that the heavenly things themſelves ſhould bee purified with better ſacrifices than theſe;</hi> and it is neceſſary ſtill that there ſhould bee the ſame way of cleanſing of ſin away, by way of Sacrifice and Blood of the New Teſtament. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28. For this is the meaning of the ſacrifices: they were oppointed for attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, almoſt all things by the Law were purged with <hi>blood,</hi> Heb. 9.22. and <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> and ſo it was then, and thereby the people are taught to look for juſtification by Chriſt. Hence there is no other way in the New Teſtament for attonement, but by the blood of ſome ſacrifice, and this is of none but Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. That is eſpecially to bee apprehended, and reſted upon by faith for Juſtification, that preſents not <hi>only</hi> to God, (by his own appointment) and his juſtice, full ſatisfaction; but to the <hi>troubled ſoul</hi> of a Sinner, peace and ſatisfaction. Now this the blood of Chriſt doth, becauſe it hath expreſly the ſatisfaction in it, and carries the pay with it. <hi>Hee made him ſin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. that is, a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> for ſin. Chriſt hath delivered us from the curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. Nothing that hee did, beſides this, could free us from the curſe. So 1 Pet. 3.18. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for us, the juſt for the unjuſt, to bring us unto God:</hi> Now when wee are brought unto God, wee are juſtified. The deſtruction of death, and Satan, is from Chriſts death, Heb. 2.14. <hi>By death, he deſtroyed him that had the power of death, that is the Devil,</hi> Rom. 5.9, 10. <hi>When wee were ſinners, wee were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> So that in Chriſt crucified, when as faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends him, there is the eſſence of juſtification laid up; and therein what may ſatisfy God, and what may ſatisfy the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſcience of a ſinner is contained; and therefore this is the ſure way, to attain a juſtified eſtate.</p>

Becauſe of the contempt that the world doth caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt crucified, it pleaſed the Lord therefore to advance and glorify the Croſs of Chriſt.

We may reaſon from both the <hi>Seals,</hi> which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God for the confirmation of faith in Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. <hi>Know yee not, that as many as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his death, and buried with him in Baptiſm,</hi> Rom. 6.4, 6. and therein wee are <hi>planted together in the likeneſs of his death,</hi> and <hi>our old man is crucified with him.</hi> So that baptiſm, hath its main reſpect to Chriſts death, and the waſhing away of our ſins by his blood; and the ſame is verified of the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23 the end of it is to ſhew forth the Lords death. Now why doth hee give us ſuch means and helps to ſtrengthen our faith in Chriſts death, but eſpecially to confirm our faith and aſſurance of our juſtification by that death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. This diſcovers unto us, the perniciouſneſſe of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrines, that make Chriſt's death onely for Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and Exemplary; that Chriſtians ſhould onely follow the example of his patience; but they deny the ſatisfaction and merit of Chriſt's death: So that they do leave no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or footing for faith to lean upon; yea, all our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion is utterly diſanulled, and fruſtrate by this means, I may ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> in the like caſe, that <hi>then our faith is in vain, and wee are ſtill in our ſins,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.17. and this is one of thoſe <hi>damnable hereſies,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.1. that brings ſwift deſtruction upon the ſouls of them that ſeduce, and are ſeduced, therefore wee ſhould take heed of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. It ſhews us the great danger of the ignorance of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:168555:84"/>Chriſt crucified;
<note place="margin">The danger of ignorance of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> which doth moſt certainly conclude the want of Faith in Chriſts blood. It is not poſſible to beleeve in any object, without ſome knowledge of it: and therefore ſuch are undoubtedly in an unjuſtified eſtate, who are thus deſtitute of this faith. If any man have ſo much as a well-grounded hope of reconciliation with God, it can bee built onely upon the death and ſatisfaction of our Saviour. Faith in Chriſt crucified is called the knowledge of Chriſt crucified, Iſa. 53.11. <hi>by his knowledge, &amp;c.</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. Surely then, if wee know not Chriſt crucified, wee do not beleeve on him, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.77.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How may it appear that the knowledge of Chriſt crucified is wanting, or obtained by us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tryals of our knowledge of it.</note> 1 By the <hi>relliſh</hi> that we have of Chriſt crucified, and the preaching of the Croſs: The preaching of the Croſs, is, to them that periſh, fooliſhneſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17, 18. Beleeving is called the eating of the body of Chriſt, and drinking of his blood, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. Now if wee cannot reliſh the doctrin of it, and it will not down with us, ſurely it is, becauſe wee know not what Chriſt crucified means. Now what little reliſh it hath with multitudes of hearers is evident, becauſe the miniſtry of it is ſo little regarded and accepted; by our drowſy, careleſs, dull, formal, and curious hearers, and profeſſors, thoſe glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings are no delight at all to them. Some ſleep ſcandalouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome gaze about, others will hardly ſtir out of doors to hear it; were it ſo, they could have ſome new Lights, or Teachers after their own luſts (ſuch preaching as maketh the Croſs of none effect) they would flock after them, and prick up their ears to hear them, but cannot down with ſuch light Manna, and plain doctrin as this is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tri.</hi> 2. The knowledge of Chriſt crucified, is an <hi>humbling knowledge, Prov.</hi> 30.1, 2, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. it putteth a Chriſtian into a mourning frame, that as long as a man lives, it will keep his ſoul in a bleeding condition, Zach. 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have peirced, and mourn, &amp;c.</hi> They are ſo ſenſible of ſin, and of the diſhonour, &amp; wrong done unto God thereby, that they are ſtill grieving under the ſenſe of it. And though a Chriſtians heart is not alwaies in the ſame frame, but ſometimes ſome deadneſs, and hardneſs is upon it; yet they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:168555:84"/>cannot be at reſt in ſuch a condition, and it is looked at, as an uncomfortable ſtate, till they recover themſelves, and a broken frame again. But where the knowledge of the Croſſe of Chriſt is unſound, it will conſiſt well enough with a proud, unbroken, untamed diſpoſition of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tri.</hi> 3. The knowledge of Chriſt crucified (if ſincere) is <hi>mortifying,</hi> and killing of the reign of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Knowing this, that our Old man is crucified with him, &amp;c.</hi> Phil. 3.8, 10. <hi>Yea doubtleſſe, I count all things but loſſe for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> What knowledge? <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. <hi>That I might know him, and the power of his reſurrection, and the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of his ſufferings:</hi> and this was, that he might undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly conclude his communion with Chriſt in his death; how ſhould be conclude that? hee addes, <hi>being made conformable to his death:</hi> and what conformity to Chriſt's death can there be without mortification of ſin? I might adde alſo thoſe places that ſpeak of the cleanſing vertue of the death of Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tri.</hi> 4. The true knowledge of Chriſt crucified, <hi>doth cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie us to the world, and the world to us,</hi> Gal. 6.14. <hi>Paul</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the world as a dead thing, a carrion which hee loathed; ſo hee looked at the honours, riches, delights, and luſts that the world dotes upon: hee looked at it as a dead Carcaſe, yea a crucified, <hi>i. e.</hi> an accurſed thing to ſet his heart upon: and though <hi>Paul</hi> was eminent this way, and above the ordinary ſort of beleevers, yet you ſhall find all the faithful, even the weakeſt have ſome meaſure of this diſpoſition in them; as <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when ſalvation came to his houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. they that minde earthly things are enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt, but <hi>our converſation is in heaven</hi> (hee ſpeaks of all the faithful) there is our trading and dealing. Briefly, the Apoſtle makes <hi>covetouſneſſe</hi> not only enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4. but intollerable in a Church of Chriſt, 1 Cor. 5.11. <hi>If any man that is called a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, &amp;c.</hi> Oh then what exceeding cauſe is there to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into our knowledge of Chriſt, to ſee what it is, if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with a covetous, or worldly frame of heart?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 3. Inſtruction to beleevers, where to caſt anchor in whatever ſtorms, or tempeſts, that wee meet withall in this
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:168555:85"/>preſent life: that is, that we <hi>pitch</hi> our faith, and <hi>exerciſe</hi> it in Chriſt crucified. O beloved in the Lord, I beſeech you, not to content your ſelves with Spiritual things in the lump, or the Myſtery of Chriſt in a <hi>heap;</hi> though they may give ſome ſweet ſavour, yet they are in compariſon like a bundle of Spices that are whole, or a Box of Oyntment ſhut up, and not poured out. If the Spices be bruiſed, and the Oyntment poured out, oh then how ſweet and fragrant is the ſmell! and ſo let us break as it were this Myſtery of Chriſt in pieces, and labour for a diſtinct underſtanding and beleeving in Chriſt: this will make theſe things farre more ſavoury; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſeveral beauties of Chriſt, as the Church did, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. ſee the beauty of every part of Chriſt. Remember what himſelf ſaid, <hi>Where the Carcaſſe is, &amp;c.</hi> this is the crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and who are <hi>Eagles</hi> but beleevers, to whom the Croſſe of Chriſt is ſavoury, and they will ſent it a great way, and flock together from farre to feed upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mot.</hi> 1. Conſider we what it is to bee a Chriſtian: truly it is to <hi>ſprout and ſpring up out</hi> of the <hi>grave</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>When he ſhall make his ſoul an offering for ſin, hee ſhall ſee his ſeed,</hi> i. e. his poſterity, and <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.24. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, except a grain of wheat fall to the ground, and dye, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth alone; but if it dye, it bringeth forth much fruit:</hi> fruit which ſprings forth from Chriſts death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. who by ſuffering death, brought many ſons to glory, i. e. the children of God and Chriſt, the whole Catholick Church, are but the ſeeds that ſprout out from a Crucified, and dying Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mot.</hi> 2. There is all ſufficiency to be had for juſtification in a crucified Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.17. <hi>Come, for all things are ready;</hi> and ſuch an one that comes, <hi>ſhall never hunger nor thirſt,</hi> Joh. 6.35. The ſoul is <hi>compleat in Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.10. and though there is nothing but emptineſſe in other things, and thoſe that feed upon them, feed on aſhes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20. and labour in the fire, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.13. follow the Eaſt wind, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.1. and ſpend their labour for that that is not bread, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1, 2. yet there is fulneſſe enough in Chriſt crurified; there is bread eough (as the Prodigal ſaith) in our Fathers houſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Mot.</hi> 4. The Lord Jeſus himſelf takes contentment, and ſatisfaction, in beleevers betaking themſelves to him, and his croſſe: <hi>Hee is ſatisfied in ſeeing the travel of his ſoul,</hi> Iſa. 53.10, 11. The woman that hath had ſore travel in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, when ſhe beholds the fruit of her body, forgets her pains, and is comforted. So it is with our bleſſed Saviour, who takes great contentment when ſuch ſinful Creatures doe fly unto his precious bloud for refuge and ſanctuary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 1. Above all things take pains to know Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified, and that <hi>experimentally;</hi> this was <hi>Pauls</hi> ſetled reſolution and determination, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. and he picks out (above all other) this ſweet flower or jewel. The phraſe is not ordinary, but it is uſed to ſignifie that <hi>Paul</hi> made it his end, that he propoſed to himſelf in Chriſt; let me tell you, there is enough in Chriſt crucified: to buſie your meditations upon.</p>

Labour to ſee the <hi>daily neceſsity</hi> of Chriſt crucified, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day as long as thou liveſt; conſider that every day, not only in regard of ſins, but the beſt duties, you have need of this <hi>bloud of ſprinkling,</hi> Heb. 9.19, 20. <hi>He ſprinkled with bloud both the tabernacle, and the people, and the book, and the veſſels of the miniſtry, almoſt all things were purged with bloud,</hi> and when the deſtroyers are abroad, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.28. there is nothing in the world can keep off the deſtroyer, but the bloud of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> Heb. 13.20, 21.</p>

It is held forth in the miniſtry of the Goſpel, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1, 2. and in the Sacraments; and there is a dreadful wrong done to the bloud of Chriſt, by unworthy receiving of the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. ſuch an one <hi>is guilty of the Body and Bloud of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:168555:86"/>Chriſt,</hi> i. e. he commits ſuch a ſin as <hi>Judas,</hi> or the <hi>Jewes</hi> in murthering Chriſt. Oh! how loud doth the bloud of Chriſt cry againſt ſuch ſinners, that ſo prophane the Lords Table, either by ignorance, or mean preparation to it? and ſo Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy from the faith, is called trampling under foot the bloud of Chriſt, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27.</p>

               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:168555:87"/>that is oppoſed to <hi>binding,</hi> by a borrowed ſpeech from Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that are bound with fetters and chains, that are very painful and grievous; from which when they are looſed and ſet at liberty, they are greatly eaſed and comforted: ſo it is with poor ſinners, it is exceeding grievous to the ſoul to bee bound with the <hi>cords of iniquity and ſin,</hi> Prov. 5.22. <hi>His own iniquities ſhall take the wicked himſelf, and he ſhall be holden with the cords of his ſins.</hi> But when ſins are forgiven, then the ſoul that was captivated by Sin, and Satan, is looſed from its bands; As a captive redeemed, whoſe ranſome is paid. It is true, the poor Sinner generally thinks himſelf moſt at liberty when he ſins moſt, and is in Satans ſafeſt cuſtody; when he is in a worſe caſe than the vileſt ſlave in the <hi>Gally:</hi> but when once he comes to the ſight of them, he ſees alſo his thraldome and bondage, he longs after a diſcharge and freedom, which he accounts the greateſt happineſſe in the world.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>What is meant by remiſſion of ſins that are paſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Some interpreters doe take it for the pardon of thoſe ſins that are committed before converſion; that all thoſe ſins, <hi>through the forbearance of God,</hi> are pardoned; which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (they ſay) not as though the pardon of ſins is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained unto them that are paſt, but paſt ſins are mentioned, to warn them that are pardoned, not to take liberty for the future, to embolden themſelves in ſin. But it ſeems to have another ſenſe, and that is, to ſignifie the forgiveneſſe of ſins, that were committed before the coming of Chriſt: wherein the Apoſtle ſhewes the reaſon why the Lord <hi>did not deferre</hi> the the revelation of Chriſt until his incarnation, but did in the dayes of the Old Teſtament, propoſe and ſet forth Jeſus Chriſt, in the times of the Patriarks and Prophets; and this was done to ſignifie unto us, that not only ſuch ſins might be forgiven, that were committed ſince his coming, but alſo ſuch as were committed before. And I incline the rather to this expoſition:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe he ſpake of propoſing of Chriſt in the Old Teſtament as a propitiation, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe hee ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. the righteouſneſs of God, which is by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, was teſtified by the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:168555:87"/>Law, and the Prophets, that ſins might bee forgiven to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, from the foundation of the World.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe hee addes <hi>[by the forbearance of God]</hi> or his long-ſuffering, whereby the Lord ſtayed in ſo long expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the comming of his Son into the World, till the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was actually made: for God would not have forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the ſins of the Fathers committed long before, unleſs that in his great patience, hee had reſpected the future propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his dear Son.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe hee alſo addes [verſ. 26. <hi>To declare at this time his rightoouſneſs</hi>] <hi>i.e.</hi> at this time <hi>ſince</hi> the comming of Chriſt, hee doth <hi>declare</hi> and ſhew forth his righteouſneſſe, which hee did not clearly demonſtrate before his ſons incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: but now hee makes all the world to ſee how juſt hee is, that hee would not forgive any ſins, no not in the daies of the fathers, without full ſatisfaction by the death of his onely begotten Son.</p>

<note place="margin">The full remiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion of ſins.</note> 
               <hi>That ſuch is the efficacy and vertue of the ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt, that it is available to the full remiſſion of all the ſins of the faithful, from the beginning of the world, to the end thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This appears to bee plain, and the full meaning of this place, in that the Apoſtle inſiſts upon the <hi>remiſſion of ſins paſt,</hi> how long ſoever before Chriſts comming in the fleſh, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death, which might ſeem all this while, either not to bee forgiven, or if forgiven, yet that it was upon ſome other account, than the death of Chriſt. But now it appears that the ſins of the Patriarks and Prophets were remitted, onely upon this ground, of Chriſts ſatisfaction promiſed and to come; and therefore much more we may conclude, that by the vertue of Chriſts death, all the ſins of beleevers <hi>ſince</hi> the coming of Chriſt, are pardoned and forgiven.</p>
            <p>Let me clear up theſe things to you, and ſhew,
<list>
                  <item>1 That this remiſſion is full.</item>

            <p n="1">1 That this remiſſion of the ſins of beleevers, is <hi>full</hi> and compleat, of all their ſins paſt, preſent, and to come; and the Scriptures are clear for it, Col. 2.13. <hi>And you hath hee quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:168555:88"/>together with him, having forgiven you all ſins and trespaſses.</hi> Wee could not bee quickened to life eternal, without the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all ſins: any one ſin retained without pardon, would keep us in a ſtate of death; and this is that which God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, Jer. 33.8. <hi>I will cleanſe them from all their iniquity, whereby they have ſinned againſt mee.</hi> Here then is no exception of any ſins, how many, and how great ſoever they were, but ſaith, <hi>I will pardon all,</hi> Iſa. 1.18. <hi>Though your ſins bee as ſcarlet, they ſhall bee white as ſnow, and though they bee as crimſon, yet they ſhall bee as white as wooll.</hi> Scarlet and Crimſon are double and deep dies, dies in Grain, yet God will take away theſe dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dies, that they ſhall be made, as if they had not been dyed at all. Though our ſins by reiterating of them, and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in them, have doubly and deeply ſeized on us; yet by Gods diſcharging us of them, wee become as if wee had never committed them. Mic. 7.19. <hi>I will caſt all your iniquities into the depth of the Sea.</hi> As when all the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Red Sea, and they ſank like a <hi>ſtone,</hi> there was no fear of their reviving again. And marvellous is that promiſe, Jer. 50. <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>In thoſe daies, and at that time, ſaith the Lord, the iniquity of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall bee ſought for, and ſhall not bee found; and the ſins of</hi> Judah, <hi>and they ſhall not bee: for I will pardon them whom I reſerve.</hi> None by any ſearch ſhall bee able to finde any ſin to charge upon Gods People, Rom. 8.34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. To diſcover to us the unexcuſable, and helpleſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of all unbeleevers, who lye under the guilt of their ſins, eſpecially in theſe times, and places, and ends of the world, who have the offer and tender of this grace of Chriſt, and yet put it away from them: for was the death of Chriſt ſufficient to ſave thoſe ſinners that lived under the Old Teſtament, that had ſo little light and ſo much darkneſſe, knowing ſo little of the Myſtery of the Goſpel; and is it not ſufficient to ſave you from your ſins, who have this grace ſo abundantly preached and preſſed upon you? Why then I ſay, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Thou</hi> Capernaum, <hi>that art lifted up to Heaven, &amp;c. it ſhall bee more tollerable for</hi> Sodome <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>than for thee.</hi> It is true, many unbeleevers periſhed before Chriſt's coming, and were left under the Wrath of God, <hi>Job</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> but innumerable perſons more in theſe dayes. Whoſe Hell ſhall be greater and hotter than theirs, to whom pardon is offered and yet refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed?
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:168555:89"/>Such cannot plead the greatneſſe and multitude of their ſins; for the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is ſo full of vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, that it exceeds the greatneſſe of ſins; ſuch ſhall have nothing to plead before the Lord one day, but their bloud ſhall be upon their own heads, becauſe they have deſpiſed the bloud of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.6. And beſides, ſee the helpleſneſſe of ſuch perſons, who though there be but <hi>one way</hi> in the world to be ſaved. <hi>Acts.</hi> 4.12. yet they ſet at nought this way. There is but <hi>one Ark</hi> to ſave them from eternal deſtruction, and that they make a mock of, as the Old world did, and now it is in vain to look for ſalvation any where elſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22. Nay this refuſal is your condemnation; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.26. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.46. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.39. and though by common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, you are ſaved from the miſeries of your outward man, yet know this, that it is another buſineſſe to bee ſaved from your ſins: and Chriſt came not to ſave us from our afflictions, but <hi>from our ſins,</hi> Matth. 1.21. and theſe are by farre the greateſt calamities, and evils, that we are ſubject to. Briefly, there you are <hi>in the gall of bitterneſſe, and in the bond of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and muſt bear your own iniquities your ſelves; and in your unbelief, are bound to keep the whole Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. and bound to the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhall I know whether the bond of my iniquity bee broken or no?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> You may know by what Chriſt tells you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, he that committeth ſin, is a ſervant of ſin.</hi> Now to commit ſin in his ſenſe, is to <hi>practiſe</hi> iniquity, or to live in the commiſſion of any known ſin; be it Pride, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, Uncleanneſſe, Malice, or whatſoever evil way it is, thou art ſtill then a ſlave of ſin, and Chriſt hath not ſet you free from the bondage of it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. <hi>When we were in the fleſh, the motions of ſin which were by the Law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death;</hi> and ſo long as theſe <hi>motions</hi> are at work, ſay not, <hi>I have</hi> Abraham <hi>to my father, and God</hi> to my Father, for there is <hi>another father whoſe luſts yee doe;</hi> and you ſee how peremptory the Lord Jeſus is in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it, becauſe he knowes the world will not eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe.</hi> 2. Comfort to beleevers in regard of this effectual
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:168555:90"/>ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and the comfort ſtands in the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their eſtate, which is</p>
            <p n="1">1 That they are diſcharged from all their ſins without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. <hi>Be of good chear, your ſins are forgiven you,</hi> Matth. 9.2. though there be ſome ſins which yee have committed, are more hainous than the reſt, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> have done, yet the <hi>grace of God is exceedingly abundant,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. and there is no ſin that can bring, or plead any accuſation againſt you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>God ſending his Son in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh, for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh</hi> i.e. all our ſin is condemned in the fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, he hath undertook to anſwer, and hath anſwered all the pleas and accuſations of ſin that are made againſt a beleever; ſo that the righteouſneſſe of God is fulfilled in us, and ſin being pardoned, God thinks no worſe of us, than if we had never ſinned.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Conſider what manner of diſcharge from ſin this is; it is perfect, and it is everlaſting. It is perfect, and leaves the <hi>ſoul all fait,</hi> Cant. 4.10. and he gave himſelf for his Church, that he might make it <hi>without ſpot or blemiſh,</hi> to preſent it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>a glorious</hi> Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.26, 27. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.9. <hi>I waſhed thee with water, yea I throughly waſhed away thy bloud,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Beſides, it is everlaſting, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. <hi>I will remember thy ſins no more,</hi> Iſa. 43.25. I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions, &amp;c. as our of a debt-book; So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.16. And though wee can remember them to charge them upon our ſelves, that were ſuch and ſuch; yet God will not charge them on us, and if he doe not who is the Judge, what hath any caviler to doe with us?</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But how can this bee, that God ſhould be ſo forgetful of our ſins?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> He ſaith, I will not remember <hi>your</hi> iniquities, that is, as <hi>yours,</hi> I have put them upon another account, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them.</hi> Q. Why, but ſuppoſe I ſhould fall again, and again into the ſame ſins, &amp;c. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt look that your faith and intereſt in Chriſt be ſound, and if it bee ſound, this doctrin will not embolden you to ſin, for <hi>we write theſe things that you ſin not,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. and then your new
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:168555:90"/>folly ſhall not be charged upon you, for you have the ſame <hi>Advocate with the Father,</hi> as ever you had; and God doth not play faſt and looſe with his ſervants, but his promiſes are all Yea, and Amen; and his Covenant (that ſhall ſtand invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable, maugre the gates of Hell) it is, <hi>to remember thy ſins no more.</hi> It may be the world judges hardly of thee, and layes theſe and thoſe Inditements againſt thee, but it is no matter, the Judge of all the world will acquit thee, and will not mention them againſt thee, either in the day of Death, or Judgement, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. <hi>It is a ſmall thing for me to be judged of you, he that judgeth me is the Lord.</hi> He that hath ſaid it, will ſtand to it, he will never remember thine iniquities, though they have been never ſo many, never ſo great, and though corruptions ſtill remain in thee, yet God ſees them not, ſo as to impute them, but to pardon and heal them; <hi>He ſees no iniquity in</hi> Jacob, &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21. Suppoſe the rod of God be upon thee, and thou ſmarteſt, and ſayeſt, Now God calleth my ſins to remembrance, yet beleeve it, God is true, when he ſpeaks of the future time, that hee will remember thy ſins no more. It may be when God afflicts you, hee would have <hi>you</hi> call your ſins to remembrance, but <hi>hee</hi> will not doe it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Conſider, that this was Gods end in giving his Son, and Chriſts end in giving himſelf, to be a <hi>Propitiation;</hi> it was for the <hi>remiſſion</hi> of ſins, <hi>i. e.</hi> for all the ſins of beleevers: and can we think that God will loſe his end? <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that his grace was not in vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. for if it bee, then it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he cannot attain his end, or becauſe he will not; if he cannot obtain his end, he ſhould not be Omnipotent, or ſomething ſhould hinder him, and be ſtronger than he; if he will not, hee would derogate from his wiſdome, to bee ſo changeable, and from his truth, that he fails not of his word and promiſe; yea that abſurdity would follow, that <hi>Chriſt is dead in vain,</hi> Gal. 2.21. which is the greateſt abſurdity in the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4 The bloud of Chriſt <hi>alone</hi> diſchargeth us from our ſins, it needs no addition to be made to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. <hi>By one offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, &amp;c.</hi> that now which is perfected by one offering, is ſpoyled by any addition whatſoever, if any thing ſhould bee
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:168555:91"/>required to be performed by us, in way of addition to it, then we were undone, and could never bee able to attain to this diſcharge. So that there is nothing left to trouble our peace, and hinder our comfort. Iſa. 35. laſt. <hi>The ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return, and come to</hi> Sion, <hi>with Songs and everlaſting joies upon their heads.</hi> It is a bleſſed time, the ranſomed of the Lord have, none can hinder their joy and bleſſedneſs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. There is nothing can hinder our bleſſedneſs but ſin, and that being ſlain by Chriſts death, our great enemy is overcome. So that the blood of Chriſt, that is available for the pardon of our ſins paſt; is alſo available for the ſins that are to come, and follow his death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3.
<note place="margin">Lay claim to pardon.</note> Inſtruction to true Beleevers. Seeing there is ſuch efficacy in the blood of Chriſt for the remiſſion of all their ſins, let them learn this high part of ſpiritual wiſdome, to lay claim to this full pardon: and let them not charge their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, with the guilt of their ſins, for this is in a ſort to leſſen, if not deny the force, and vertue of the death of Chriſt, which is to bee abhorred by every Chriſtian. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.2. They that are <hi>once purged, have no more Conſcience of ſin,</hi> i.e. of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and guilt of ſin unſatisfied for: if God and his word conclude us to bee under ſin, then wee muſt conclude ſo too; but if they diſcharge us, and ſet us at liberty, then ſhall wee wrong Scripture, wrong God, and Chriſt, and our own Souls, to charge our ſelves with the guilt of our Iniquities. One would think Beleevers need not any advice in matters of this nature: but it is a ſure rule, that the Carnal man and unbeleever, thinks it the eaſieſt matter in the World, to put over all his ſins upon Chriſt, and perſwade his heart that his ſins are pardoned: whereas a Beleever accounts it a difficult buſineſs, to remove the mountains of ſin, and as it were by faith to caſt them into the midſt of the Sea: ſo as to conclude the Remiſſion and Forgiveneſs of all their ſins. So that they have great need of this advice: and the want of this wiſdom, is that which breeds ſo many bad thoughts, fears, doubts, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and darkneſſe in the hearts of true beleevers. When as ſometimes they think upon their ſins, they are ready quite and clean to ſink them; thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 38.4. <hi>Our Iniquities are gone over our heads, &amp;c.</hi> with <hi>Job,</hi> Job 13.26. <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt mee, and makeſt mee
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:168555:91"/>poſſeſſe the ſinnes of my Youth.</hi> Job 14.16, 17. <hi>Thou watcheſt over my ſins, thou ſealeſt up my Tranſgreſſion in a bag, &amp;c.</hi> and with <hi>Moſes,</hi> Pſal 90.8. <hi>Thou hast ſet our iniquities before thee, and our ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance;</hi> who ſpeaks there in behalf of the Church, then in diſtreſſe. This is that which is ſo grievous to Chriſtians, in caſe of temptations, and deſertions ſpiritual, that they look at their ſins as unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, or ſtanding in full force againſt them: and ſo the death of Chriſt as invalid, and not reaching to the pardon of them. Truely, in ſuch and the like caſes, I know not what to call it, whether Pride, or Weakneſs, or Folly, that poor Beleevers do frame inditements againſt themſelves, and take their debts upon themſelves, which the Lord Jeſus hath diſcharged; And it is like, as if ſome poor man were caſt into Priſon for debt, and ſome rich friend ſhould lay down a full ſumme to diſcharge the debt, and cancell his bonds, and ſo ſet him at liberty, and hee refuſe the kindneſs, and ſay, nay, but this payment is not ſufficient, but I muſt diſcharge it my ſelf, or elſe I will never come out: What will you call this? Truely, this is your caſe, that your ſpirits are over-whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with your ſins; you go like malefactors with fetters, and bolts about their heels; Though your liberty is purchaſed, and the Priſon doors are ſet wide open, yet you will not bee delivered, and come out. You account not the pay of Chriſt current, and go about drooping, diſcouraged, and uncomfortable, diſabling your ſelves for any duties; and create needleſs miſeries to your ſelves. Well, remember the point and uſe in hand, that the blood of Jeſus Chriſt hath cleanſed us, <hi>i. e. [all true beleevers]</hi> from <hi>all</hi> iniquities, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. <hi>Thou haſt caſt all my ſins behind thy back:</hi> It is a borrowed ſpeech from men, when they regard not a thing, they caſt it behind their backs, and thus God doth with the guilt of beleevers ſins.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But is not this a ground of looſeneſs, prophaneneſs, and incouragement to Libertines, Drunkards, and Unclean perſons?</hi> for they will ſay, why ſhould wee bee troubled for our ſins, how many ſoever wee have committed; ſeeing Chriſt by his death, hath purchaſed the full remiſſion of our ſins? therefore they think they may revel, carouſe, ſwagger, drink, whore, cozen, what not? and need never bee troubled for their ſins.</p>
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:168555:92"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is juſt the conceit of the <hi>Familiſts</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians,</hi> that maintain, wee need not to bee troubled for our ſinnes, and that juſtified perſons have nothing to do with repentance any more; or if they do repent, they do undervalue Chriſt, and his Death, as if hee had not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſatisfied for our ſins. Now to prevent the cavils of ungratious hearts, and to give Gods people that porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Inſtruction, that belongs to them, I anſwer in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is no unbeleever hath any ground in the Word, to conclude the pardon of his ſins, in the ſtate of his unbeleef: or that hee hath any real benefit by the death of Chriſt. If they conceive otherwiſe, they couzen their own ſouls. Heb. 10.38. <hi>If any man with-draw himſelf, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him,</hi> that is, he will not pardon him; Joh. 3.18. <hi>Hee that beleeves not is condemned already;</hi> The ſentence is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſſed upon every unbeleever in the Word of God: yea, and in the Counſel of God upon him, that ſhall continue obſtinately and finally in the ſin of unbeleef; whereby ſuch great indignity is offered to Gods Grace and Word; and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, ſuch horrid rebellion and unthankfulneſſe to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; For ſo it follows, <hi>becauſe hee hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> Surely hee that is condemned for ſin, hath not the remiſſion of ſin, but is going to execution for ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2 There is no unregenerate, unſanctified, or diſobedient perſon, but is an unbeleever: and therefore deſtitute of any comfort in Chriſts death. This the Scriptures do clearly hold forth: for Regeneration and Faith goe together, 1 Joh. 5.1. <hi>Whoſoever beleeveth that Jeſus is the Chriſt is born of God. Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12, 13. They that beleeve are ſanctified. Heb. 10.11. <hi>By one offering hee hath perfected for ever them that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</hi> Without obedience there is no faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. and dreadful is that place (ſpoken of Chriſt) Exod. 23.21. <hi>Provoke him not, obey his voice, for hee will not bear your tranſgreſſions</hi>(ſo it may bee rendred) <hi>hee will not carry your load;</hi> or bee it; <hi>he will not pardon, &amp;c.</hi> this is ſpoke of Jeſus Chriſt by God the Father, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that rebelled againſt him found that the Lord made it good, whereas ſo many thouſands periſhed in the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:168555:92"/>Wilderneſs; and ſo ſhall all the like perſons finde in theſe daies, and to the end of the world; for certainly to a wicked man, nothing is pure, <hi>To him that is defiled and unbeleeving,</hi> Tit. 1.15. <hi>but grace teacheth to deny ungodlineſs, &amp;c.</hi> Tit. 2.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. therefore ungodly, unrenegerate, unſanctified, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient perſons, have no portion or lot in this buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3 There is no greater ſign of an unſanctified, unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and wicked heart, than to make an <hi>unſanctified</hi> uſe of the grace of God, and to abuſe the doctrin of it, to wantonneſs, and licentiouſneſſe. There can bee no greater character of an ungracious heart, and a ſwiniſh ſpirit, that hath nothing to do to challenge theſe Goſpel pearls, neither knows the nature, property, and worth of them.</p>

            <p>Queſt. 1 <hi>How far a true beleever that hath intereſt in Chriſt, and his ſins forgiven him, may charge his ſoul with ſin?</hi> This muſt bee cleared, that wee may avoid the Rocks that ſome Sectaries do claſh againſt, and I ſhall clear it in theſe Concluſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Every beleever is bound impartially to find out, by ſtrict examination of himſelf, the <hi>ſecret corruptions that are in his heart,</hi> or any ungodly practices that are in his Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: yea, ſo as to judge himſelf for them, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry leaſt of them, is ſufficient to bring Gods curſe on him, and the guilt of eternal condemnation; ſhould not the Lord of his free grace in Chriſt prevent it.</p>
            <pb n="177" facs="tcp:168555:93"/>
            <p>Every ſin in its own nature and power, doth and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure guilt and condemnation to the ſoul, unleſs that Chriſt by the merit of his death doth free us from it. God called for this ſearching formerly, in times of the Churches calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.40. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.5, 7. Thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>ſet your hearts upon your ways.</hi> Yea, this is commanded to every one that receives the Lords Supper, 1 Cor. 11.28, 31. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, not onely concerning his Faith, but alſo concerning</hi> his ſins. Yea, hee addes, that wee ſhould diſcern and judge our ſelves, which ſelf-judging is to proceed to ſelf condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. When God hath given his a new heart and ſpirit, then they ſhall remember <hi>their own evil waies and doings that were not good, and loathe themſelves in their ſight,</hi> or judge themſelves worthy to bee deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>I ſay not that beleevers ſhould judge that they <hi>ſhall</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but onely that they are <hi>worthy</hi> to bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Beleevers, notwithſtanding this forgiveneſs, ought to <hi>mourn</hi> for their ſins. Ezek. 7.16. <hi>They that eſcape ſhall every one mourn for their iniquities, like the doves in the vallies.</hi> Iſa. 59.11. <hi>We roar like Bears, &amp; mourn like doves,—for our tranſgreſſions are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed.</hi> So <hi>Peter</hi> having denyed his Lord, remembred the words of Jeſus, <hi>and went out and wept bitterly,</hi> Matth. 26.75. yea, this the Lord commands us, Jam. 4.8, 9. <hi>Bee afflicted, and mourn, and weep, and let your laughter bee turned into mourning.</hi> Sin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned is ſin, and calls for ſorrow; and ſorrow according to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Beleevers are bound (for all the forgiveneſs of ſin) <hi>to confeſs and acknowledge their iniquities;</hi> it is notable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that was practiſed by <hi>Paul,</hi> even in his laſt daies, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.—15. where hee laies open his ſins of perſecution, and blaſphemy, hee calls himſelf the chiefeſt of ſinners, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee ariſes to ſay, that the grace of God was exceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant towards him, &amp;c. This alſo the Lord requires of us, Jer. 3.13. <hi>Onely acknowledge thine iniquities,</hi> and 1 Joh. 1.9. <hi>If wee confeſſe our ſinnes,</hi> &amp;c. as if hee ſhould ſay, that otherwiſe wee cannot lay claim to the promiſe of forgiveneſs. It is wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful divinity of ſome in theſe times, that a Chriſtian ſhould not confeſs ſin.</p>
            <pb n="171" facs="tcp:168555:94"/>
            <p n="4">4 Repentance, and that often <hi>renewed,</hi> for ſins frequently committed, is ſtill required, of the beſt beleevers, Ezek. 8.30. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Repent, and turn your ſelves from all your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, ſo iniquity ſhall not bee your ruine;</hi> and Chriſt ſaid to the Diſciples, Matth. 18.3. <hi>Except you bee converted and become as little Children, &amp;c.</hi> The Diſciples themſelves have need to bee converted ſtill: So that Repentance is neceſſary to beleevers, by neceſſity of Precept, as it is alſo by neceſſity of Means to diſpoſe and quality, at leaſt, for the comfort of remiſſion: yea, no childe of God can have the comfort of pardon, before hee hath repented.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But you will ſay, a true beleever hath pardon of his ſin, though hee hath not the comfort of it, without repentance: yea it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a beleever ſinning may dye without repentance, and go to heaven, as</hi> David, <hi>lying ſo long in his great ſins, might have been taken away without repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is poſſible, yet God uſually gives ſpace to repent to all beleevers, and Chriſt hath purchaſed repentance for thoſe that hee hath purchaſed remiſſion for, and gives them together. Repentance and Remiſſion go hand in hand together; hence ariſeth another neceſſity of repentance, <hi>viz.</hi> a neceſſity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and conſtitution, as an inſeparable evidence of faith and forgiveneſſe, and a determined means or condition of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping death and damnation. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.1, 3. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 36 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22.</p>
            <p>Oh! let us bee perſwaded, to maintain and increaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in our hearts, as long as wee live, not as though thereby wee can make God amends, or ſatisfy the juſtice of God by it, that is an ignorant and Popiſh conceit, nothing can <hi>ſatisfy,</hi> but the death of his Son, and his blood; but conſider that,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Chriſt hath commanded, that repentance and remiſſion of ſins ſhould in his Name be preached to all nations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.47. Thoſe things that are to bee preached together, are to bee received together. It is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the bitter ſweet</hi> of the Miniſtry, and muſt bee joyned, yea, mixed together as a moſt wholeſome confection. So the Paſſeover was to bee eaten <hi>with bitter hearbs.</hi> Chriſt alſo gives them together, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:168555:94"/>and God hath exalted him for this end, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By our continued and unfeigned repentance wee ſhall have many, and ſingular benefits, as,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Hereby wee ſhall come to know experimentally the bitterneſs of ſin, as well as the ſweetneſſe of it. It is good to look upon ſin, as full of <hi>gall and wormwood,</hi> Jer. 2.19. <hi>See and know what evil and bitter thing it is, &amp;c.</hi> Zach. 12.10. <hi>They ſhall bee in bitterneſs, as for a first born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Thy repentance will cauſe thee to <hi>prize the pardon</hi> more, and to eſteem the grace of God in Chriſt much more. Hee that is throughly pained with ſickneſſe will highly eſteem the Phyſician; when <hi>Davids</hi> bones were <hi>broken,</hi> hee praies for multitude of <hi>tender</hi> mercies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.1, 7, 8. and ſo it was with <hi>Paul, Rom</hi> 7.24.25. Our ſpiritual conflicts in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of our Conſciences for ſin, make us to judge the better of the grace of Chriſt towards us; in his grievous ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, when hee cries out, <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.</hi> and ſay with <hi>Paul, The grace of God was exceeding abundant,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.14.18.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Repentance is a grace, that plows up, and ſtirs the heart, fitting of it for the ſeed of the Word to take better root in it. <hi>Plow up the fallow ground,</hi> Jer. 4.3. and when this is plowed, and plowed deep, the ſeed is not ſo likely to bee choaked with thornes. Repentance will make a thriving and fruitful Chriſtian, under the means of grace; and one that ſhall have a plentiful and joyful harveſt. <hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy hee that goeth forth with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bearing pretious ſeed, ſhall come again with rejoycing, bringing his ſheaves with him,</hi> Pſal. 126.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Repentance breeds a <hi>patient</hi> frame of heart under Gods afflicting hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereas otherwiſe at ſuch a time, the heart will be very unruly and outragious. Take <hi>David</hi> in his ſaddeſt time that hee under paſſed after his great ſins, when his heart was kindly broken, hee would juſtify God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. and this is becauſe it makes us humble, and laies the heart low in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of our great unworthineſſe of the leaſt mercy, and deſert of the greateſt judgements from Gods hands: and then what ever God threatens, yea, whatever he inflicts, the heart is quiet, ſilent, and patient, not in the leaſt repining
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:168555:95"/>againſt, but juſtifying of God in all his wayes.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Repentance makes the heart charitable, and pittiful to others that fall into ſin; and will keep us from rigour and pride, in cenſuring of them too ſeverely from the remembrance of our ſinful failings and frame of ſpirit, as <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2, 3. <hi>Shew meek<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe towards all men, for we our ſelves were ſometimes fooliſh, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 This repenting frame, is a <hi>Sin-mortifying</hi> frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. No grace carries on the work of mortification more in the heart than repentance, ſeeing it is continually weeding out, and plucking up the remainders of corruption in the heart. Sin no ſooner ſhews it ſelf, but a broken heart is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of it, and mourning for it; God hath placed this grace in a beleevers heart, to bee continually cleanſing out and throwing forth, the filth and dreggs of corruption, ſtill adhearing to the heart in this life; and hence it is that wee read after all the faylings of the moſt precious Servants of God, the wheel of <hi>repentance</hi> was ſtill turned over their ſins, though they were fully certified of pardon and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concl.</hi> 2. A beleever (whatſoever his faith is) had need be <hi>fervent and inſtant</hi> in prayer for the pardon of his ſin. This our Saviour taught his Diſciples in the rule of prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.12. and we are ſtill to doe it in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe our ſins are daily renewed, and wee had need have pardon renewed, and remiſſion afreſh applied unto us, as our ſins are renewed: therefore we had need continually be praying for this, that our ſins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That we may get <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>aſſurance</hi> of pardon, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe. Worldly men would not only <hi>have</hi> outward E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, Lands, and Poſſeſſions, but they ſeek to have <hi>aſſurance</hi> thereof. Now this aſſurance of pardon is not gotten ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily without much contention in prayer, <hi>Hab.</hi> 6.11. <hi>We deſire that every one of you doe ſhew the ſame diligence, to the full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, &amp;c.</hi> It is much to bee lamented, that any Chriſtian ſhould content himſelf, with an opinion, or conjecture of forgiveneſſe, and ſo become no other than <hi>James</hi> calls them, chap. 1.3. <hi>Double-minded, men, unſtable in all their wayes.</hi> A double-minded man is ſuch a one as is alwayes queſtioning
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:168555:95"/>Gods grace in Chriſt unto him, and his intereſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whereby he is very <hi>unſtable,</hi> and here he contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without indeavouring a ſtability of faith and aſſurance, to ſay with <hi>Job, I know my Redeemer liveth.</hi> Wee have need of a great increaſe of faith, and meaſure of aſſurance that our ſins are pardoned, that wee may bee able to undergoe great trials, and ſtrong temptations, and to lay up like the rich man, <hi>riches for many years;</hi> and (with <hi>Joſeph</hi>) ſtore of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion <hi>againſt the years of famine.</hi> For ſo the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> when they had <hi>much-aſſurance,</hi> received the Word in great affliction, with joy in the Holy Ghoſt, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5, 6. Oh then a daily courſe of prayer is needful, that wee may get the ſenſe and feeling of the mercy of God to our ſouls, in the pardon of our ſins. Yea this is more than naked aſſurance, when a man can feel the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. when a man is <hi>ſealed</hi> with the holy Spirit of promiſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. and hath the <hi>earneſt</hi> of his heavenly inheritance in his heart. Many by the ſtrength of their faith, have truſted in Gods mercy, even then when the Lord hath <hi>hid his face from them,</hi> or ſhewed them an angry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, but the <hi>feeling</hi> of the grace of God is more: this is for the heart to find the <hi>warmth</hi> of his love, and behold the gracious <hi>ſmiles</hi> of his countenance in the loweſt condition, and it is a very heaven upon earth, or a lively fore-taſte of the joyes of heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3 This is needful, that the ſoul may have the pardon of fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in all the <hi>fruits</hi> and effects thereof, in their further <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments</hi> and perfection; though wee are freed from the damnation and dominion of ſin, yet wee are not freed from the remainders of it. Wee know how <hi>Paul</hi> groaned under his unmortified corruptions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23, 24. and the Church is taught to pray, <hi>Take away all iniquity,</hi> and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.2. wee muſt look ſometimes to meet with terrours of Conſcience, and to bee in darkneſſe without any light, wee muſt look for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions and temptations by reaſon of the remainders of ſin, and therefore we are to pray for full redemption from ſin, in all the fruits and effects of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It is needful to pray, that we may make a <hi>right uſe</hi> of the pardon of ſin, having once obtained it. For the heart is apt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:168555:96"/>under ſuch a favour to wax proud, and wanton, and careleſſe; as it is with many an ungodly childe, when a father hath made over a great eſtate into his hands, he will care no more for his father, nor doe any duty belonging to a childe: ſo the children of God would doe being left to themſelves, when God hath made known to them this bleſſed eſtate of the pardon of their ſins, they are ready <hi>in their proſperity to ſay, they ſhall not bee moved,</hi> Pſal. 30.6. and there is no ſtate <hi>ſo proſperous</hi> as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned eſtate. And this right uſe of pardon ſtands in deep hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and abaſement of our ſelves, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.63. <hi>That thou mayeſt remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more; becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 2 Another uſe of it is in vigilancy and watchfulneſſe at all times, and in all places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. 3 In a reſolved care and conſcience of obedience for the time to come, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.33, 38. 4 To love God ſo much the more; as the poor woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47.</p>
            <p>Now I come to ſhew you how farre a Chriſtian ought to goe, in comforting his ſoul about the forgiveneſſe of his ſin.</p>
            <p n="1">1 A beleever holding his integrity ſhould never conceive,
<note place="margin">How farre a beleever ought not to charge his ſoul with ſin.</note> or let his heart be perſwaded, that any of all his ſins ſhall ever bring guilt upon him, ſo as to cauſe Gods revenging juſtice to bind him over to wrath. If any one ſhall doe ſo, hee ſins and bears falſe witneſſe againſt God, and his own Soul. It is one thing to ſay we are <hi>worthy</hi> to bee condemned, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to ſay, or think, we <hi>ſhall</hi> be condemned indeed. For, <hi>there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 8.1. becauſe Chriſt hath condemned their ſin; ſins guilt is on them, as the Viper on <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, which he ſoon ſhook off without any hurt. Or like the Lions in the Den where <hi>Daniel</hi> was caſt, who though they were hungry, God ſhut their mouthes, and they had no power on <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 6.22, 25. but when they who cauſed <hi>Darius</hi> to make the Decree were caſt in, the Lions tare them ſuddenly in pieces, before they came to the ground. Juſt ſo it is with the ſins of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the ſins of wicked men and unbeleevers: the ſins of the faithful, though they are of a killing and Lion-like nature,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:168555:96"/>(for the wages of every ſin (in it ſelf) is death) yet the Lord Jeſus in the behalf of beleevers, ſtops the Lions mouthes, and takes away the guilt, and the condemning power of it, ſo that it cannot hurt them. But when it meets with an unbeleever, it ſoon ſlayes him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.21. <hi>Evil ſhall ſlay the wicked,</hi> yea <hi>ſin ſhall lye at his door,</hi> Gen. 4.7. the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the unclean perſon ſhall devoure him; the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ſtubborn ſhall plague him; the pride of the haughty and ſcorner ſhall rend the very caul of his heart one day, &amp;c. but ſo it is not with poor beleevers, though their ſin hath teeth, and jaws, and power to make them <hi>worthy</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, yet it ſhall never be able to <hi>faſten</hi> condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Every faithful ſoul is bound to perſwade his heart, that God doth not, nor ever will charge any one ſin upon him. He will never follow the Law upon him here for his hurt, curſe, or miſchief in this life. God may indeed <hi>hide his face from him,</hi> and <hi>write bitter things againſt him,</hi> and deal with him as an angry Father with a diſobedient Childe; but will never proſecute him at his Law, as an enemy, or Judge; but a beleever may ſay with holy <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 13.15. <hi>Though hee ſtay me, I will put my trust in him,</hi> becauſe <hi>he ſees no iniquity in Jacob,</hi> Numb. 23.22. What is that? Not to trouble you with the deluſions of the Familiſts, the meaning is, that the Lord takes no notice of the ſins of his <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to impute them, or to puniſh them, but only to pardon, cover, and cure them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. all the ſins of beleevers meet in Chriſt as in the center, like ſo many Diameters of a Circle; or as all the Rivers meet in the Sea, ſo all the Sins of beleevers on Chriſt in the full puniſhment and curſe of them. Therefore let every beleever make conſcience to conſider what God hath revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Promiſe, and take heed that you make not God a Lyar, and be ſure that you are diſcharged from all your ſins by Chriſt; but let not any unbeleever, or prophane perſon, meddle with this priviledge, for he hath no part or fellowſhip with it, they ſhall bear their own drunkenneſſe, ſcorning, Sabbath-breaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all manner of prophaneneſſe; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is let looſe, iniquity is upon them, and the flying roul of Curſes, and Divine vengeance is gone forth againſt them.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:168555:97"/>
               <hi>They have ſinned, and be ſure their ſin will find them out,</hi> Num. 32.23. as a Bloud-hound findes out a Thief. But you that are beleevers, glorifie the name of Chriſt, and his Death, and I charge you take heed, what you ſay or think in this caſe, as though God would avenge himſelf on you, or deal with you as an enemy.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Every true beleever ſhould exempt his ſoul from any fear, of the charge of any ſin upon it, by any accuſer in this world, ſo as to break off the love of God in Chriſt from him. Famous is that bold challenge of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?</hi> be it Devil, or World or Conſcience, there is nothing can be of ſuch force and power as to affright us, as though wee might fall from the love of God, whereby hee hath loved us in Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 A beleever ſhould take heed of ſpeaking, or thinking that God is ſo diſpleaſed with him, as to neglect him, reject him, or forget him for his ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.27, 28. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou O</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ſpeakeſt, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>my way is hid from the Lord &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 49.14. Sion <hi>ſaid, God hath forſaken mee, &amp;c.</hi> yea though he ſhould fall into ſome foul ſin, yet hee ſhould not conceive his condition hopeleſſe, and helpleſſe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. though he muſt ſee that he repent, and bee ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably humbled for ſuch falls; but this is his comfort, when hee falls he ſhall ariſe, not periſh-through hardneſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, but be raiſed by true remorſe, hearty ſorrow and humiliation for his ſins, or any one in particular, that he hath fallen by.</p>

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. It is exhortation, to the performance of ſeveral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, about or concerning the pardon of our ſins.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Wee ſhould learn from hence <hi>highly to eſteem</hi> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgiveneſſe of our ſins, for theſe grounds,</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe it is a peculiar property of God,
<note place="margin">A property of God to forgive ſin.</note> belonging to the Lord alone, to forgive ſin; that is expreſſed in the text in theſe words <hi>[through the forbearance of God]</hi> forbearance and remiſſion belong only to the Lord, as his Prerogatives royal, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin, Iſa.</hi> 47.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</hi> Mic. 7.18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:168555:97"/>Iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> Oh! there is an infinite evil in ſin, and therefore requires an infinite power to remove it. Hence it is made an argument of the God-head of Chriſt, to forgive ſin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.5. and this is a greater argument than the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any miracle; true, in a ſenſe it is attributed alſo to the Apoſtles: <hi>whoſe ſins ye remit, &amp;c.</hi> but this is but miniſterial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the Court of the World, or Church: but in the Court of heaven, none but God can forgive ſin.</p>
            <p>Now this ſhews the tranſcendent excellency of this grace,
<note place="margin">The worth of Chriſts blood.</note> that it is the only remedy in the World, for the diſeaſe of ſin, it is God only can cure us with the blood of Chriſt, and this is the greateſt miracle that ever was wrought for us, that we read of in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The great force of forgiveneſs appears, by the price that was paid for the purchaſe of it. It was <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, the worthy pretious blood of Jeſus Chriſt. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. and it is expreſſed in the text in the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>his own blood</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> notes, <hi>The blood of Jeſus Christ his Son.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.17. Aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods love was ſo great to his onely begotten Son, that if any creature could have laid down a ſufficient price, he would not have ſent his Son, out of his own boſome, to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Or if any other excellency in Chriſt, as the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his nature, or his active obedience could have procured the pardon of ſin for his Elect, Chriſt ſhould not have dyed for that end: but Chriſt muſt bee offered to take away the ſins of many, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27, 28. It is as if a ſubject have a diſeaſe, that can bee cured no other way, than with the heart blood of the Prince, for no other potion than ſuch an one will heal ſins diſeaſes, and wounds, for the Lord himſelf (who is the onely wiſe God) would not lay down more than was neceſſary, and hence hee ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</p>
            <p n="3">3 The worth of it appears, becauſe this is a <hi>leading grace</hi> in the new Covenant. And though there bee many other bleſſings, in the Covenant of Gods grace purchaſed by Chriſts blood: (for it purgeth our conſciences, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. nouriſheth all grace, and works the growth and increaſe of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.55. and gives us an entrance into the holy of holies. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19) I ſay, though all other ſpiritual bleſſings do flow from Chriſt,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:168555:98"/>yet remiſſion of ſins is the chiefeſt of them, the firſt grace in communion, and the firſt in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> ſoul that is united unto Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. When wee are <hi>juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith,</hi> then follows peace, and joy, and acceſs to God, &amp;c. As a King firſt receiving a Rebel into favour, forgives him his treaſon and diſloyalty, then hee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> in this caſe, wee are all rebells againſt God, and wee can expect nothing at the hands of God, till our guilt, curſe, horror, and expectation of vengeance bee removed.</p>
            <p>Now this cannot bee removed till Faith. All unbeleevers being under condemnation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. So that pardon belongs onely to beleevers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. laſt; and ſuch an one <hi>David</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth bleſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.12. for forgiveneſs brings a man into favour with God; and our ſalvation ſtands in it, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.77. Oh let theſe, and many other conſiderations, ſtir up men highly to prize forgiveneſs of ſins. Remarkable is the reproof by the Evangelical Prophet, Iſa. 55.2. <hi>Wherefore do you spead your ſilver, &amp;c.</hi> why are you ſo eager about baſer, inferiour things? you do but loſe your mony, and labour, after them.</p>
            <p>Moreover, conſider that Remiſſion is equally beſtowed on all beleevers: Though ſome have more ſins forgiven them than others; yet all beleevers have their ſins equally forgiven them, the weaker ones, as well as <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.22, 23. and therefore being attainable by the weakeſt beleever, all ſhould look after it, as a matter of greateſt importance. If we felt but the weight of guilt once, wee ſhould know what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.4. Let the conſcience bee once arreſted by God, and perſued by Divine Juſtice, it would bee then like the entangled ſurety, Prov. 6.4. <hi>Hee would give no ſleep to his eies, &amp;c. but would deliver himſelf, as a Roe from the hands of the Hunter, and as a bird from the hands of the Fowler.</hi> Now I beſeech you brethren, get and maintain this experience of a wounded ſpirit; get a clearer underſtanding and ſenſe of your own guiltineſs, together with the loathſomeneſſe of ſin: and then wee ſhall know how to value the mercy of forgiveneſs. None can prize health, but a ſick and languiſhing perſon; nor food, but the hungry. So that when your ſoul is truely
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:168555:98"/>pained with the horror of ſin, then you will know better what the remiſſion of ſin is: as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exh.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. The ſecond branch of this Exhortation is, to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy your true prizing of Remiſſion, by unwearied diligence in the uſe of means to obtain it; as,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Leave not your heart and Conſcience till they are ſhiftleſs, and paſt all carnal evaſions, in regard of the charge of ſin. It is moſt ſure, that every ſoul naturally is at <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> with Chriſt; hee is one of the <hi>Citizens that hated him,</hi> and will not come at him, as long as wee can ſhift without him. So it was with the Prodigal, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.14, 17. that would not come to his <hi>Father, till</hi> hee had ſpent all, and was driven to feed Swine, yea, to feed with them, and no man gave to him: So that hee was put beyond all his ſhifts before hee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. So God deals with ſinners, as Rom. 11.32. <hi>God hath ſhut up all in unbeleef, that hee might have mercy upon all.</hi> Gal. 3.22. <hi>The Scripture hath ſhut up all in ſin, &amp;c. Gods ſhutting up</hi> in both places ſeems to be by putting them beyond their ſhifts, by the full convictions of his word, that they have never a ſtarting hole to eſcape by. Oh beloved! there is never a ſoul inlightned, living under the means, but is in a maze, and runs from hole to hole, from mountain to hill, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ferreted out of one hole runs into another. There is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in this caſe, whilſt you are running <hi>(like Adam)</hi> to ſhift into a wood, far away from God, as you think, <hi>but all your ſtrong holds muſt bee pulled down,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Take a thorough ſurvey of the free offers of Chriſt, and him crucifyed, to every ſoul, that hears the Goſpel preached, and this is both by God the father, and Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Now in this caſe conſider two things, 1 What end the Lord hath, or can have, in offering himſelf thus to a vile ſinner; who ſhall bee the gainer if wee do receive him? or the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer if wee receive him not? what ſaid <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt to our Saviour, though hee were more than a Prophet? Mat. 3.14. <hi>I have need of being baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to mee?</hi> to bee ſure wee have need of Chriſt, but hee hath no need of us. Yea, what need hath Chriſt of a filthy beaſt, a Drunkard, Scorner, Murderer, Atheiſt? as <hi>Achiſh</hi> ſaid of <hi>David</hi> in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:168555:99"/>of leſſer moment, 1 Sam. 21. laſt, yee ſee <hi>the man is mad, have I need of mad men?</hi> conſider what objection or excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thou haſt, or canſt make againſt the offer of Chriſt; doſt thou think hee gets any thing by thee? <hi>If thou bee righteous, what giveſt thou him? Or if thy tranſgreſſions bee multiplyed, what doſt thou unto him?</hi> Job 35.6, 7. thou art but a loſt man at the beſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. See then yee refuſe not him that ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. leſt the King bee wrath, and ſend his Armies againſt you, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.7.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Obſerve the ſweet Invitations of Chriſt, and the perſons, whom hee doth invite to come to him, with their qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. His offers are more general than his Invitations, which are of particular perſons, ſo and ſo qualified, <hi>The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and heavy laden,</hi> Matth. 11.28. <hi>The thirſty,</hi> Joh. 7.37. <hi>The poor, the meek, the broken-hearted, the blind, the captives, &amp;c.</hi> Such who <hi>groan</hi> under theſe infirmities, Luk. 4.18, 19. hee calls and invites theſe, to Riches, Liberty, Eye-ſight, to a Jubilee, an acceptable year of the Lord. Hear therefore and fear, all yee ſtubborn, ſtiff-necked, Impenitent, hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinners, whoſe Conſciences can evidence your unbroken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for ſin, and that it is your greateſt content, that you have elbow-room enough for the Commiſſion of it: and your greateſt trouble is, when Commands or Threatnings croſs you in it; expect not a good look from Chriſt in this condition. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. hee reſiſts the proud, &amp;c. but on the contrary, the poor, broken-hearted, humble ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhall bee welcome to Chriſt; for a <hi>contrite and bruiſed spirit, hee will not despiſe or caſt off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 You muſt look at it as abſolutely <hi>neceſsary</hi> to get Chriſt, and to ſtir up earneſt and reſtleſſe deſires after him. This is the thirſt that Chriſt calls for: and it is wrought by a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his worth. Joh. 4.10. <hi>If thou kneweſt the gift of God, &amp;c.</hi> for the deſire is anſwerable to that certain and clear judgement, that wee have of the neceſſity, worth, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the great gift of God. The Merchant ſees the Pearl to bee of unſpeakable price, and therefore meditates the attaining of it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.44, 46. Deſires are not to be dead and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, but eager and careful for the getting and poſſeſſing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating bleſſings. Iſa. 26.9. <hi>With my ſoul have I deſired thee in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:168555:99"/>the night, yea, with my spirit with a mee will I ſeek thee early, &amp;c.</hi> This is the taking the Kingdome of heaven by force. Now ſuch an one will not only cry, God have mercy on mee, &amp;c. or uſe ſome formal Prayers for pardon, but will cry earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wraſtle for it, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.1, 2. Sin is ſoon committed, but pardon is not ſo ſoon obtained; a ſickneſs or wound is ſoon got, but a cure is a long and buſy work <hi>Pſa.</hi> 69.3. God will have us have pardon in his order, and for right ends; It is Gods order that wee ſhould have Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified before remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19. So that hee that is not in Chriſt, muſt not think to get a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But ſhould not a man out of Chriſt pray for pardon? Or is it in vain ſo to do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, for if thy caſe were as bad as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his caſe, thou ſhouldeſt pray for it, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.22. but you muſt not think to have it without Chriſt; but firſt Chriſt, and then pardon, and ſo God is ready to forgive, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.5. Beſides, ſeek pardon for a right end: it may bee thou wouldeſt onely bee eaſed of thy horror, but that alone is a ſiniſter end, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>.4.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Hence we ſhould learn, by all means to get the pardon of ſin cleared to our hearts: this doth neceſſarily flow from the tranſcendent excellency of forgiveneſs. A wiſe man in a caſe of this nature, would not contentedly bee in the dark; a condemned malefactor is not ſatisfied by knowing a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don may bee had, but hee would fain have it in hand, and read his own name in it; and ſuch muſt bee our care in this, which is a greater matter.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How ſhould a ſinner get the pardon of his ſins cleared unto him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It muſt bee thy main care to clear up thine intereſt in Chriſt, and then it will bee clear. Many think it enough to ſay, that Chriſt dyed for ſinners, and that Juſtification is by Chriſts blood: why beloved, the Devils are perſwaded of this. What is a poor man the better, to bee perſwaded there is Gold at the Indies? or the hungry man, that there is meat at the Cooks ſhop? or the Prodigal, that there is bread in his fathers houſe? hee may periſh for hunger for all that. Belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:168555:100"/>we ſhould be of <hi>Pauls</hi> mind, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>Yea doubtleſſe I account all things loſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Mark the words, 1 That there is an <hi>excellency</hi> in the knowledge of Chriſt, above other knowledge, 2 He ſuffered <hi>the loſſe of all</hi> other things for it. 3 He did this not out of a raſh zeal, but adviſedly, hee ſaid, <hi>I account, &amp;c.</hi> 4 Conſider what kind of knowledge this was, that <hi>Paul</hi> made ſo great account of, it was the <hi>ſuper-excellency of the knowledge</hi> of Chriſt; and again, <hi>I account all things but droſſe and dung that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him.</hi> To know Chriſt to be my Lord and Saviour, to win him, and wear him as mine own. Then a man is ſafe. As a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man married to a rich Husband, if ſhe bee arreſted for Debt, ſhe will plead that ſhe is under <hi>Covert baron,</hi> and the Law takes no hold of her, but of her Husband; ſo it is with a poor beleever, that is married to Chriſt; but they that are ſingle perſons (as unbeleevers are) muſt anſwer their own debts, and lye in priſon for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Labour to clear up the efficacy of Chriſt's bloud unto thy Conſcience; that is <hi>the Fountain ſet open for ſin, and for uncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> Zach. 13.1. Heb. 10.22. for the ſprinkling of us from an evil Conſcience, and the healing of all our Spiritual mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as well as for the pardon of our ſins, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 103.3. <hi>Who forgiveth all thy ſins, and healeth all thy diſeaſes.</hi> Yea, this is certain, that that ſin that is not healed in ſome meaſure, is not pardoned, and if one ſin be unpardoned, on ſin at all is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Now what is the healing all diſeaſes? but the killing luſts and corruptions in the heart: when the ſoul doth not only forſake the practice of ſin, but it hates it, and will not let it get power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. and many things may <hi>conduce</hi> to the killing of it, but nothing doth it like grace. Education may doe ſomething, the Law ſomething, Civil honeſty ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and Afflictions ſomething, but Grace conquers all. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34, 38. See then what the bloud of Chriſt hath done, towards the ſhealing thy ſins, and killing thy corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Endeavour to clear up to faith in Chriſts bloud; and it may be cleared from the Spiritual buſineſſe it ever puts the ſoul upon, it is active like the veſtuous woman, which puts <hi>her hand to every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>In the two verſes, 19, 20. the Apoſtle ſhewed before <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> that Juſtification is not by the works of the Law; now he ſhewes <hi>Affirmatively</hi> how we are juſtified, and that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. 1 By the matter of it <hi>[The righteouſneſſe of God]</hi> amplified by way of oppoſition to the Law <hi>[without the Law, i. e.</hi> without the works of the Law] any way <hi>Co-working,</hi> or
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:168555:102"/>
               <hi>meriting</hi> our juſtification. 2 This is ſet forth by the Adjunct, of the approbation, and teſtimony of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. 3 By the inſtrument, that is, faith of Jeſus Chriſt, underſtand it not <hi>actively,</hi> for the faith whereby Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved; but <hi>paſſively,</hi> the faith whereby Chriſt is beleeved on. 4 The ſubject, <hi>beleevers,</hi> and thoſe univerſally and emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſet down <hi>[unto all, and upon all that beleeve.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is meant by the righteouſneſſe of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not to be underſtood of that whereby God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is righteous (as <hi>Oſiander</hi> ſaid) for that is eſſential to God, and cannot be communicated to the Creature; but this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is elſewhere called the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and the righteouſneſſe of faith; this may appear clearly by the oppoſition, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3, 4. <hi>The Jewes went about to establiſh their own righteouſneſſe, and would not ſubmit to Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> and there Gods righteouſneſſe (in contra-diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to that which is our own righteouſneſſe) is yet explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be our righteouſneſſe for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe <hi>God appointed this</hi> righteouſneſſe, for the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of a ſinner, <hi>The righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith,</hi> Phil. 3.9. i. e. of Gods inſtitution and appointment, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is called Gods righteouſneſſe, becauſe Chriſt who is the ſubject of it, is God-man, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6-8.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is ſo, becauſe it is God who is the <hi>giver</hi> of it, and not only ſo (for he gives inherent righteouſneſſe alſo) but that God <hi>only</hi> imputes it out of the free riches of his Grace; whence the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. <hi>The righteouſneſſe which is of God by faith,</hi> i. e. ordained and imputed by God, and made ours by faith apprehending of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It is called Gods righteouſneſſe, becauſe it is ſuch as <hi>pleaſeth</hi> God, and which he in his ſtrict juſtice doth approve of; for this will make the man bleſſed, to whom it is apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6.</p>
            <p>There are here two Points I deſire to inſiſt on.</p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>It is the righteouſneſſe of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</note> 
               <hi>which the Scripture holds forth for the Sinners juſtification, and this righteouſneſſe of God is made the ſinners, by way of imputation;</hi> this I take to bee the meaning of that phraſe <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto all, and upon all them
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:168555:103"/>that doe beleeve]</hi> i.e. Gods righteouſneſſe is beſtowed on them for juſtification.</p>
            <p>For the opening of this, it will be inquired, What is the righteouſneſſe of God that is here ſpoken of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of Chriſts active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience.</note> 1. It is the whole obedience of Chriſt, both <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive,</hi> that is, ſuch a righteouſneſſe as every man ought to yeeld and perform unto God, and that is, firſt paſſive, in a way of ſuffering penalty for his tranſgreſſion; this every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth owe to God by the ſentence of the juſt Law, which requires that the ſinner ſhould ſuffer <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Curſe</hi> for his ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. 2 The ſinner oweth obedience unto God, beſides ſatisfaction for his former breaches; for the Law ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. the man that <hi>doth</hi> theſe things ſhall live in them; not the <hi>hearers, &amp;c.</hi> but the <hi>doers</hi> of the Law ſhall be juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. It ſtands not with reaſon, that laying or inflicting the penalty threatned for tranſgreſſions, ſhould make man thereby become <hi>lawleſſe,</hi> or not bound to the poſſitive duties of obedience. Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſinner oweth all this righteouſneſſe, Chriſt our Suer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt needs fulfill all this righteouſneſſe for ſinners, that is, both dying, and doing as it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.15. and all is comprchended in <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>That hee was obedient unto the death,</hi> which implies that there is an obedience that <hi>falls ſhort</hi> of death; as alſo a further obedience in <hi>ſuffering</hi> death: in which reſpect it is alſo ſaid, that Chriſt is <hi>the end of the Law, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 10.4. now the <hi>end</hi> of the Law, is perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, both in doing what is commanded, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the due puniſhments: therefore Chriſt was to perform both.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt was <hi>moſt perfect,</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be added to it; but that righteouſneſſe that is both active, and paſſive, is more perfect than his paſſive righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alone. For ſuppoſe that a Malefactor hath ſuffered the whole puniſhment of the Law for his offence, it is required to his future righteouſneſs, that hee ſhould doe that which the Law requires; ſo it is required of us; but wee cannot fulfill the Law our ſelves, therefore Chriſt muſt fulfill it for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That which Chriſt did as a Mediator, he did not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:168555:103"/>but for us; but all that Chriſt did after his Incarnation, were Actions of a Mediator; for as ſoon as ever he was God-man, he was our Mediator, and if his active obedience were the obedience of a Mediator, then it was performed for us, as ſuch; for it is certain that every action of a Mediator tends to reconciliation. Now to ſay that his active obedience did fit him to be a Mediator, cannot conſiſt, for how could that fit him to bee <hi>God-man,</hi> that was done after the word was made fleſh? <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is the righteouſneſſe of God requiſite for our Juſtification?</hi>

            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That the righteouſneſſe of God is Imputed to beleevers, or is conveyed to beleevers by way of Imputation.</hi> 1 Imputation is not expreſſed in the Text, but its neceſſarily implyed and underſtood: for the righteouſneſſe of God cannot bee conceived any way to bee mans, but only by way of Imputation. Becauſe it is not righteouſneſſe, that is, or
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:168555:108"/>can bee wrought by a meer man.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Though inherent righteouſneſs in Beleevers may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods righteouſneſs, as ſome take <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. yet the Apoſtle cannot mean that here: becauſe hee ſpeaks of <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs without the Law, and the works of the Law:</hi> beſides, the Apoſtle treats here of Juſtification, as it is plain; but inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſs belongs to ſanctification.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It is ſaid, that the righteouſneſſe of God <hi>[is to all, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that beleeve]</hi> that is, it is appointed unto them, upon them, <hi>i.e. accounted</hi> theirs, or put upon them by way of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It is the righteouſneſſe of God by faith, <hi>i.e.</hi> apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by faith; Other Scriptures do conſent to this truth.

            <p>For the opening of this, ſomething had need bee ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Imputation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, becauſe it is a term that the Papiſts do Cavil at, taking the Scripture word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> to ſignify <hi>Thinking,</hi> or doubtful opinion; for how can that bee aſcribed to God, as this is? <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. but the word ſignifies to <hi>Reckon,</hi> or <hi>Account,</hi> taken by a borrowed ſpeech from Merchants reckonings and accompts, who have their <hi>debt-books</hi> wherein they ſet down, how their reckonings ſtand in the particulars they deal upon. Now in ſuch debt-books, Merchants uſe to ſet down whatever payments are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:168555:109"/>only made, either by the debtors themſelves, or by others in the behalf of them, an example whereof wee have in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> verſ. 18. where <hi>Paul</hi> undertakes to <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> for <hi>Oneſimus, If hee hath wronged thee, or oweth thee any thing, put that on my account:</hi> i.e. Account <hi>Oneſimus</hi> his debt to <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Pauls</hi> ſatisfaction, or payment to <hi>Oneſimus.</hi> Which Anſwers the double Imputation in Point of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>i.e.</hi> of our ſin to Chriſt, and of Chriſts ſatisfaction to us, both which are implyed, 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>Hee made him to bee ſin for us (i.e.</hi> our ſin was imputed to him) <hi>that wee might bee the righteouſneſs of God in him (i.e.</hi> his righteouſneſs might bee imputed to us.)

               <note place="margin">Definition of Imputation.</note> 
               <hi>according to his good will and pleaſure, whereby as a judge hee accounts the Beleevers ſins unto the ſurety, as if hee had committed the ſame; and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt unto the beleeever, as if hee had performed the ſame obedience that Christ did, in his own perſon.</hi> So that Chriſts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteouſneſs is as effectual to the full, for the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the beleeving ſinner, as if hee had yeelded ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Lord himſelf: hence his righteouſneſs, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our righteouſneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. It is true, there is mention of a double imputation, Rom. 4.4, 5. <hi>now to him that worketh, is the reward reckoned, not of grace, but of debt; but to him that worketh not, &amp;c.</hi> Here bee two Imputations, the one hath the ground <hi>in him</hi> to whom the Imputation is made; the other is founded on the <hi>will</hi> of him that imputeth. If any man doth perfectly perform thoſe things that the Law command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the reward of righteouſneſs is imputed to him according to debt; for this hath the foundation in himſelf, and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect performance; but if a man works not, but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſgreſſed the Law, beleeveth, to him the reward of righteouſneſs is accounted according to grace: for it hath a foundation <hi>out</hi> of himſelf, in <hi>anothers</hi> performance, <hi>viz.</hi> in Chriſt. Which the Apoſtle proves, verſ. 5. <hi>To him that works not, &amp;c.</hi> If the imputation ſhould bee made, according to the foundation that is in himſelf, ſin ſhould bee imputed to condemnation, for hee is ungodly; but now faith is account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>ungodly</hi> for righteouſneſs; therefore this muſt bee
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:168555:109"/>founded on the grace of him that imputes. The former kind of imputation is onely by way of <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> and no man was ever juſtified by it in the ſight of God: but the latter is the common way, whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> and all beleevers are juſtified in Gods ſight.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>It ſeems to bee an unrighteous act, and implies falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to impute righteouſneſs to a ſinner; as it is to impute ſin to a righeeous perſon, Prov.</hi> 17.15.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This will not follow; becauſe 1 The beleever is ſtill a ſinner in himſelf, ſo was not Jeſus Chriſt the righteous. 2 Becauſe the vertue that is in the head, is communicated to all the members, it doth not therefore follow that every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is thereby made a head, to have ſuch an influence into all the other members as the head hath. 3 Redeemer, Saviour, Surety, &amp;c. are denominations, proper to him as he is a pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and ſatisfier of the Law in the behalf of others; and not as any thing is due from himſelf; and although his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by a Legal Imputation to us, and acceptation on our behalf, is called ours, and wee may bee properly ſaid to bee righteous in his righteouſneſs: yet his ſurety-ſhip (as ſuch) cannot bee imputed ours: hence none of thoſe deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, as of Saviour, Redeemer, &amp;c. So that though we be pay-maſters and ſatisfiers of the Law, under this imputation, and by Gods account, yet we are not therefore ſureties or redeemers. For it is proper to us onely to bee <hi>redeemed,</hi> not to be <hi>redeemers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, whereby hee ſatisfies the Law, is applyed by imputation to the beleever: not his Surety-ſhip, Redeemer-ſhip, becauſe proper onely to the <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and not communicable to the <hi>redeemed,</hi> ſo much as by imputation, for Redeemer and Redeemed are <hi>Relata er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go oppoſita:</hi> neither doth the Law in demanding Satisfaction, look at Surety-ſhip, but paiment: whether it bee in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the offender, or of the ſurety. Therefore this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on falls to the ground as vain and frivolous: for though the Law calls a ſinner perfectly righteous in his juſtification, yet it calls him not a ſurety, or a Redeemer, for the Law calls not for a Surety, &amp;c. but accounts the ſinner as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous touching the demands of the Law, as one that never brake the Law, yea, as the Surety himſelf made under the Law, for ſatisfaction to the Law, by Active or Paſſive Obedience, do equally diſmiſs, or acquit the perſon that is under it, from the Guilt, Curſe, or Condemnation of it.</p>

Taken from the <hi>union</hi> of the beleever with Chriſt; for being once made one with Chriſt, all his benefits become his; ſo that the righteouſneſſe of the head is communicated to all his members. The <hi>oyntment on the head of</hi> Aaron, <hi>ran down on his skirts and members.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> deſired <hi>to bee found in Chriſt, not having his own righteouſneſſe,</hi> Phil. 3.9. hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the <hi>righteouſneſſe which is through faith,</hi> i. e. imputed righteouſneſſe, apprehended by faith: and hee ſhews the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why it is made the beleevers, becauſe we are <hi>found in him:</hi> that is, ingrafted into his Myſtical body, and are made one Myſtical perſon with him: and this will ſerve to anſwer Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh objections.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though the righteouſneſſe bee compared to a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Scripture, yet the Perſon of Chriſt is really united to the beleever, which cannot be ſpoken of a garment.

               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. From the compar ſon between the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam:</hi> for as <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, is imputed to all his poſterity, and that in reſpect thereof they are reputed ſinners, and accurſed, and liable to eternal death; ſo alſo Chriſts obedience, whereby he fulfilled the Law, is ſo imputed to the members of his <hi>Myſtical</hi> body, that in regard of God they ſtand as innocent, juſtified, and accepted to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. The Argument is <hi>Pauls,</hi> Rom. 5.19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience, many are made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>As by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſſe, ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As <hi>Adam</hi> was the common root of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ſo his ſin is imputed to all his poſterity; ſo Jeſus Chriſt is the common root of all the faithful, and his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is imputed to them all. For it were abſurd to ſay, that <hi>Adams</hi> ſin had more power to condemn, than Chriſt's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe hath to ſave: or that God ſhould not impute Chriſt's righteouſneſſe, as well as <hi>Adams ſin.</hi>

Now that is in the text, that it is <hi>Gods</hi> righteouſneſſe that the beleever hath, yea that is more, that there is but that <hi>only</hi> righteouſneſſe for all beleevers. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>By the righteouſneſſe of one, the free gift came upon all men for juſtification of life.</hi> Were it any other than impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteouſneſſe, it would be manifold; as many as there are juſtified perſons; but it is ſaid to bee the righteouſneſs of one, that comes upon all men.</p>

               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. From the imputation of our ſins to Chriſt; for therein is a ſufficient ground of the imputatatio of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. How was Chriſt <hi>made Sin</hi> for us? Not ſin inherent, for he had no ſin: but by imputation. So likewiſe the beleever is made Gods righteouſneſs; not by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent righteouſneſs, but by righteouſneſs imputed.</p>

               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1.
<note place="margin">To men that truſt in inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> To ſhew us the unjuſtified eſtate of thoſe that truſt in ſome inherent righteouſneſs, as looking to bee juſtified thereby. Which is not only the curſed Doctrin of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts (for then I ſhould not trouble you, or my ſelf, now with it) but it is deeply in every carnal heart: that we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally juſtifiers of our ſelves (ſuch as the Phariſees were) which is ſo dangerous a gulf, that there is this double inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table danger following thereupon.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That confidence in our own righteouſneſs, doth ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly exclude us from the righteouſneſs of God, and imputed righteouſneſs. <hi>Christ is made of none effect to them that ſeek to bee juſtified by the works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 10.3, 4. Gal. 5.4. It is in this caſe with the ſoul of a man, as it is with his body. Though a deadly diſeaſe doth poſſeſs moſt of the parts, yet it may be curable; but where the throat ſwells, or the vital paſſages are ſtopped up, that a man can receive neither food nor phyſick, every man will ſay, that ſuch a Patient is but a dead man. So it is in the ſouls caſe. True it is, that every ſin is of a deadly nature, and ſome more than others; Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and Adultery, and Murther are foul ſins; yet there is an <hi>Hyſop</hi> in Chriſt's Bloud that cleanſed <hi>David</hi> from them: but if a man truſt in his own righteouſneſs, this ſtops the <hi>Wind-pipe</hi> and the <hi>throat,</hi> yea obſtructs all the paſſages of the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:168555:111"/>ſpirits from the head: ſo that it ſtrangles the ſoul, that it can receive no help from Chriſt; As the caſe was with the proud Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11, 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2 This maks a man unprofitable under all the means of grace, be they never ſo precious: that a proud Profeſſor in many a year ſhall be never the better for them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5, 6. <hi>Curſed is the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arme, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord, for hee ſhall bee like the heath in the Deſart, and ſhall not ſee when good cometh, but ſhall inhabit the parched places in the Wilderneſſe, in a ſalt land and not inhabited.</hi> Mark, in the place are theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The text reacheth to truſting in our ſelves, as well as truſting in others: it is truſting in <hi>man,</hi> and <hi>fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 It extends to all falſe confidence, that is, in a <hi>departure of the heart from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 That whatſoever good comes to others, be it Spiritual or Temporal, ſuch ſhall not ſee it, or injoy it; the parched Heath is not the better for Sun or Rain; i. e. for any means of grace; all the preaching in the world ſhall never pluck a man into a ſtate of Salvation, whilſt he continueth in ſuch a condition, or be made to bring forth any fruit unto God; for all our fruit proceeds from Jeſus Chriſt; neither will there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee any ſaving grace wrought in the heart, unleſſe he bee the root and bottom of it; from whoſe righteouſneſle all ſap, nouriſhment, motion, yea all vital ſpirits are to bee drawn.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But ſuppoſe a man doth not altogether truſt in his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, but only in part, and in ſome lower degree, is there ſuch danger in this? ſo that Chriſt's righteouſneſſe be our foundation, and our own righteouſneſſe in truſted in an inferiour degree, is there likely to be ſo much hazard of our ſalvation in this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is but juſt thus with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that divide their confidence between Chriſt's righteouſneſſe, and their own, in the point of Juſtification. But <hi>Paul</hi> was not of their mind, who would have <hi>none</hi> of his own works, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. and <hi>David,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.16. I will make mention of <hi>thy righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> and thine <hi>only.</hi> Mark the Emphaſis doubled, <hi>thine, and thine only.</hi> It is a great policy of Satan in this caſe to tell us,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:168555:112"/>that it is good to have <hi>two ſtrings to our bow:</hi> that if one break, another may hold, and ſo <hi>two are better than one.</hi> It is true, ſuch policy is many times lawful in humane affairs, and ſome Spiritual, but ſtark naught in the point of juſtification. There muſt be but one only righteouſneſs, and that muſt bee Gods too. It is obſervable among Naturaliſts, that for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the parts of the body are doubled, two hands, two eyes, two Tongues (the Palat being <hi>Lingula,</hi> a little Tongue) the Liver double (the Spleen being a little Liver) the Lungs alſo (having two Lobbes or parts) two Leggs, &amp;c. but there is but one Heart, and but one Head. So there are many graces required in a Chriſtian, but there is but one Lord, one Faith, one Righteouſneſs, but if there be more it is monſtrous, yea dangerous too, as it was with the veſſel in <hi>Acts</hi> 27.41. <hi>Whoſe fore part ran a ground, and ſtuck faſt; and the hinder part was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the violence of the ſea.</hi> So hee that truſts partly on <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Righteouſneſs, and partly on his <hi>own,</hi> will hazard the wracking and undoing of his whole ſoul, in reſting any part on the ground of his own own righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>But here are two Cavils to be removed.</p>
            <p>Obj. 1. <hi>Carnal perſons will ſay, Is it ſo, that all our own righteouſneſſe, our praying, hearing, receiving, reading, &amp;c. cannot juſtifie us? and all our holy duties cannot make us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before God? let us then caſt away all care about theſe things; let us ryot, and be drunk, and prophane the Sabbath, and live as we list, for all our righteouſneſſe and holineſſe will not juſtifie or ſave us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This Objection ſmells of Popery too, but take theſe three particulars for anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1
<note place="margin">Why duties are to bee done, though they doe not juſtifie.</note> That howſoever thy good works are not enough to juſtifie and <hi>ſave</hi> thee, thy evil works are enough to <hi>damn</hi> thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.12. <hi>That they might all bee damned who beleeved not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſſe;</hi> let all prophane wretches conſider it, that take pleaſure in drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and looſe converſation, that gibe and jeer at all holineſs, and means of grace. There is room enough in Hell for every one that doth evil, and eſpecially, who living under the Goſpel, yet delight in wicked courſes. It is ſure thy evil works are perfectly evil, and will condemn thee; but thy good
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:168555:112"/>works are not perfectly good, therefore cannot juſtifie thee: nay, thy prayers are abominable, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.8. As the beſt diet is not able to make a man immortal, yet poyſon hath ſtrength enough quickly to diſpatch him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 They that doe thus abuſe Gods grace in Chriſt, let them know, that as any ſin allowed is enough to condemn them, ſo this is a ſin of unconceiveable hainouſneſs, and out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſinful, to incourage themſelves to ſin by the grace of God in Chriſt; That whereas Chriſt came into the world, to <hi>deſtroy the works of the Devil,</hi> they make Chriſt the means to <hi>maintain</hi> the works of the Devil, and ſay, <hi>Wee will therefore ſin, becauſe grace abounds,</hi> Rom. 6.1. but the Apoſtle ſaith with deteſtation, <hi>farre be it;</hi> Oh <hi>deſpiſeſt</hi> thou the <hi>riches</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. thou who liveſt within the bounds of the Goſpel preached, where the Angels deſcended from Heaven, to hear and rejoyce in the free grace of God, and his righteouſneſſe, doſt thou deſpiſe it? then thy prophaneneſs is not bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, but there is a treaſure of vengeance in it, and thou that wilt neglect publick, private, and ſecret duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot juſtifie thee; art not only wickedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, but treaſureſt up the greateſt wrath and indignation, that Law and Goſpel can provide for a ſinner. Therefore pray, that if it be poſſible the thoughts of thy heart may bee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Let all ſuch Objectors, and Cavillers at grace, know, that it is carnal confi ence in our own righteouſneſſe, or in the means of grace, that is a ſin that toucheth Gods Crown, that turns all our righteouſneſs into filthineſs, and withdraws the bleſſing from the means, and hinders the benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them; <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is an abomination, how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</hi> Prov. 21.27. The Jewes followed after the Law of righteouſneſs, yet attained not unto it; the reaſon is, becauſe they followed after a <hi>falſe</hi> righteouſneſs, and ſo brought all their ſacrifices with wicked hearts. But thoſe things which were gain to <hi>Paul,</hi> he accounted loſs for Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7. that is, when ever hee put any confidence in them, he counted that he loſt by them, and ſo aſſuredly wilt thou.</p>
            <p>Obj. 2. <hi>Again, ſome men will ſay, Why ſhould wee hear, and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:168555:113"/>pray, and ſanctifie the Sabbath? continue in ſin we may not, and it ſeems the doing of duties will doe us no good? what good ſhall we have by all our righteous courſes, and what profit is it to walk mournfully and holily before the Lord, and what uſe is there of all other ſervices, if we cannot be juſlified by them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, there is a great uſe of them, and much good to had by them. I will not inlarge this now, but take a few things for your preſent ſatisfaction. See <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4, 5. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, of <hi>the appearing of the kindneſſe and love of God</hi> towards us, for juſtification by Free Grace, and then a man might ſay, to what purpoſe is good works injoyned, if not for juſtification? He addes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>Let ours learn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good works for neceſſary uſes.</hi> So there are <hi>uſes,</hi> and <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> uſes for our good works, though they are <hi>uſeleſſe</hi> as to juſtification. So that it is as if a man ſhould ſay, What ſhall I doe with my mony, ſeeing I cannot eat it? and my houſe, ſeeing I cannot carry it about? &amp;c. but no reaſonable man will argue ſo, but will ſay, I can buy meat with my mony, and dwell in my houſe, &amp;c. So there are other neceſſary uſes for which Gods works are to bee maintained, though they juſtifie not.</p>
            <p n="1">1 God will meet thee in the way of good works, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.5. <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth; and worketh righteouſneſs, thoſe that remember thee in thy ways.</hi> Is it nothing to meet with God, and to have fellowſhip with him in his ways, worſhip, and ordinances?</p>
            <p n="2">2 God ſhall have a great deal of glory by it. <hi>Bee filled with the fruits of righteouſneſſe, which are by Jeſus Chriſt, unto the glory and praiſe of God,</hi> Phil. 1.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3 You your ſelves ſhall have much benefit thereby. <hi>Thy righteouſneſſe may profit the Sons of men,</hi> Job 35.8. though it cannot profit God.</p>

It appears by our pulling down of mans righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It is the nature of it to throw down all other righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, as to the buſineſſe of Juſtification. It is an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted effect, of the <hi>ignorance of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh our own righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 10.3. now the phraſe is taken from the ſetting up of a King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.11. or the ſetting up of a God, as a <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.24. beſides, <hi>ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> our ſelves to the righteouſneſſe of God, implyes as much, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſoveraignty or rule that Gods righteouſneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of Sinners; and the Apoſtle ſaith, Gods Kingdome <hi>ſtands</hi> in it. Now this pulling down of mans righteouſneſſe, it is as the pulling down of one Magiſtrate, and ſetting up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in his ſtead, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.19. and when hee is down from his place and dignity, no man will reſpect him, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any Government or Power from him; ſo in this caſe, the beleever gives no reſpect to, or makes any account of his own righteouſneſſe; he looks at it as <hi>droſſe and dung,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did: he expects no acquittance or diſcharge by it from his ſin, or any healing vertue in it. But on the contrary, whatever ſins a Juſtitiary commits or lives in, hee thinks with himſelf hee can heal himſelf again at pleaſure, by ſome ſervices hee can perform. He will faſt, and pray, and hear, and be ſorry, and amend, and then all will be well. It was the guiſe of the people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4 that cryed, <hi>the Temple of the Lord;</hi> to whom the Lord ſaid, Verſ. 10, 11. <hi>Will yee ſteal, and murther, and commit adultery, &amp;c.</hi> See the like, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.37-40. It is ſo with a falſe heart that lives in any vile courſe, when his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is awakened, he hath his God immediatly to give him a pardon, it is but humbling my ſelf a little the more, and praying a little the more, and ſo he will make God amends: this is ſetting up our own righteouſneſſe, and Mountebank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, who can wound himſelf, and drink poyſon, and heal himſelf with his Balſoms and Antidotes at his pleaſure. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13. <hi>If the righteous truſt to his righteouſneſſe, and commit iniquity, all his righteouſneſs ſhal not be remembred;</hi> truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in righteouſneſſe, and committing iniquity goe together, ſo that there is always a ſlighting of ſome ſin, whereſoever there is confidence in our own righteouſneſſe.</p>

It is our <hi>yeelding</hi> up our members unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. Such an one will indeavour to give God and man his due, in his whole converſation.

            <p n="3">3 Imputed righteouſneſs is alwaies joyned <hi>with poverty of spirit, habitual humility, &amp; ſelf abaſement:</hi> that is a marvellous low apprehenſion of a mans ſelf, or whatever he hath, or doth, ever did, or can do, ſo as to expect by vertue therof any accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with the Lord. <hi>Paul</hi> is an eminent example of this, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6, 7. <hi>Paul</hi> a <hi>Phariſee</hi> was very ſtrict, <hi>touching the righteouſneſſe of the Law, blameleſs,</hi> and had many other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which hee before <hi>accounted gain</hi> to him; but now thinks them <hi>loſs.</hi> How can that bee? can a man bee a loſer by his righteouſneſs? zeal, ſtrictneſs? yea, the greateſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer in the world, when hee exchangeth Chriſts righteouſneſs for them: ſo that when a man thinks hee is rich enough in his priviledges and duties (as <hi>Laodicea</hi>) and therefore will not look out after the riches of Chriſt, hee is an undone man, but now <hi>Paul</hi> looks at Chriſt as his only gain. As if he ſhould ſay, I am a very loſer by my righteouſneſs, it had been better for mee never to have had it, than that it ſhould hinder me from Chriſt. (Beloved) this will be the frame of heart in him that hath imputed righteouſneſs; but hee that is full with his Duties, and Parts, and Gifts, will bee ready to ſleight Chriſt. Why, hee hath ſuch gains comming in this way, that though hee profeſs Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, yet hee makes little account of him. And ſo will prove at laſt like
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:168555:115"/>the proud Phariſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. to deſpiſe and ſleight the parts and duties of ſincere-hearted juſtified Publicans, and go away himſelf at laſt unjuſtified.</p>

The Church her ſelf could ſee abundance of filthineſſe in her righteouſneſſe, how much more can the Lord? But the comfort of a beleever is, that although hee hath no righteouſneſſe of his own, wherein hee can ſtand before God; yet hee hath Gods righteouſneſſe, which is far better than his own, and ſuch as in Gods account goes for his, as if he had done it himſelf.

               <hi>Motiv.</hi> 2. This is the end of all the book of God, to bring a poor ſinner to this imputed righteouſneſſe. Rom. 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe. &amp;c.</hi> that is, the end of the Law, was not that a ſinner ſhould ſeek to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thereby, ſeeing that when it is broken, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> can onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn a man: But this is the main end of the Law, that it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected unto Chriſt, where the ſinner may finde imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. But now this end doth not pertain to the Law as ſuch, as it contains the Covenant of Works; for ſo it conſiſts in man onely, and exacts perfect obedience at his hands, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of the curſe, and eternal condemnation: neither hath any reference unto Chriſt, but as the law is turned into another way, into the Channel of the Goſpel; to bee a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter and help to the Covenant of Grace, and as an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid to the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is ſo imputed to beleevers, that in it, they have the end of the Law, and the law it ſelf doth acknowledge, that in Chriſts righteouſneſſe it hath attained its end. Hence well might the Apoſtle ſay, the Jews followed after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>yet attained not to the Law of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 9.31. becauſe they miſſed Chriſt; and therefore the Law muſt thus needs miſſe its end. But by imputed righteouſneſſe we do fully attain to the end of the law, and the end is more excellent ſtill than the means. It gives perfection, meaſure, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, to the means. Now this end ſhould make us love
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:168555:117"/>and highly eſteem the Law it ſelf. But how much more the Goſpel, ſeeing it is not only the end of it, but the main drift, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſcope of it, properly as ſuch; Rom. 1, 16, 17. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of God, for therein is the righteouſneſſe of God revealed from faith to faith, &amp;c.</hi> This then is the main end, and proper work, and ſcope of the Goſpel, to reveal effectually the righteouſneſs of God to a ſinner. So that wee are aiming here at the right mark, and very intent and ſcope of the whole book of God: Where wee have an eye to this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and preſs after it. But if wee miſs it, and ſleight it we ſleight and miſs all the benefit of the Scripture, and whole book of God; and all the work of the miniſtry is in vain, our praying, hearing, reforming, and all in vain. Oh (then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) as wee love either Law, or Goſpel, or both; yea, as wee love our own ſouls, let this righteouſneſs bee in our eye, and in our hearts, by all means and indeavours.</p>

It is exceeding requiſite, to have a diſcovery of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt made unto us, this white raiment, that we may buy it to cover our nakedneſs, and that wee may ſee this raiment, wee have need of Chriſt's eye-ſalve, and this is not a general diſcovery only, that Chriſts righteouſneſs is provided for ſinners, and that it is to bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but it is particular and reſpecting our ſelves. It is for a man to bee wiſe for himſelf, and to bee convinced of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, worth, and excellency of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, in relation to the naked and needy condition that hee himſelf is in; And this will make a man deſire, as <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>hee may be found in him.</hi> It alſo breeds deliberate thoughts, and ſerious projects for the ſupplying our wants. Beſides, it is ſo ſtrong and effectual, that it will not ſuffer the ſoul to reſt without it, and concludes thus, I muſt go unto Chriſt for his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or elſe I periſh.

For if a ſhip have never ſo good tackling, and have no winde, and be becal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it makes no ſpeed towards its haven. 2 Hee ſees the need of Chriſt to cover the weakneſſes of his ſervices; and for this his heart is on Chriſts righteouſneſſe: ſeeing that no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice will bee accepted, but what comes thorow the hands of this High Prieſt; who is alſo the only <hi>Altar, Heb.</hi> 13.10. 3 As the ſubſtantial injoyment in all means and ordinances.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have treated of the chief Points here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that is the righteouſneſſe of God, and that conveyed by way of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; and there is one particular more that belongs to the principal Scope of the Apoſtle; which is of <hi>Paſſive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by Faith:</hi> and the Apoſtle ſeems to dwell upon this, that hee may point out the perſons to whom Juſtification belongs; <hi>i. e. Beleevers;</hi> and hee expreſſeth it,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The righteouſneſs of God which is through the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That ſets forth the Inſtrument, apprehending and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold upon Gods righteouſneſſe, that is <hi>Faith,</hi> illuſtrated by the <hi>Object</hi> of it, Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is ſaid to bee unto all,</p>
            <pb n="229" facs="tcp:168555:119"/>
            <p n="3">3 Upon all that beleeve.</p>
            <p>For the underſtanding whereof, we are to know, that which alſo was ſaid before, That the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt is not to be conceived <hi>Actively,</hi> to ſignify the faith <hi>whereby</hi> Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, but <hi>Paſſively,</hi> the faith whereby Chriſt is <hi>beleeved on.</hi> So it holds forth, that Faith as it juſtifies, hath Chriſt eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the object of it; that is, That it is faith in the Lord Jeſus, that eſpecially juſtifies a ſinner in the ſight of God. There bee many other things, though beleeved and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith, yet do not juſtify a ſinner. But it is faith in Chriſt Jeſus, that eſpecially juſtifies. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this latter hath been handled in part before, I ſhall not now inſiſt upon it.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is meant by that phraſe, or thoſe phraſes,</hi> unto all, and upon all that beleeve?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some underſtand the former <hi>[unto all]</hi> to belong to the Jews, that did or ſhall beleeve: and the latter <hi>[upon all that beleeve]</hi> to belong to the beleeving Gentiles: but this Expoſition, doth not ſhew us the reaſon of the change of the Prepoſitions: Therefore I prefer another ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>[unto all]</hi> ſignifies Gods <hi>decree</hi> of the juſtification of all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. 2 That <hi>[upon all]</hi> ſignifies the execution of the decree, in the fulneſſe of time to all beleevers, and onely to them. God in his eternal Counſel appointed this grace to all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and onely to them: and God in his good providence imputes it, and applies it onely to beleevers, as ſuch. And that this is the ſcope, appears, by what is added by way of Interpretation <hi>(for there is no difference)</hi> the meaning whereof is, that all true beleevers have the ſame like ſpiritual benefits, and though ſome have a ſtronger faith, ſome a weaker, yet they are all beleevers, and there is no difference in regard of their eſtate, and the main priviledges thereof.</p>
            <p>Doct. 3. <hi>That the righteouſneſs of God is both appointed before time, and Imputed in the fulneſs of time, indifferently to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and only to them;</hi> Or thus, That all, and onely true beleevers, have attained unto, and are partakers of Gods imputed righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Although there bee difference amongſt beleevers, in regard of the fruits of faith, as Love, Repentance, Holineſſe, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:168555:120"/>bedience, &amp;c. and in the degrees of faith, Some have a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſome a weaker. Yet in regard of Imputed Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe there is no difference at all, they are all elected alike, to the injoyment of imputed righteouſneſſe, and it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed for them equally, and they are equally partakers thereof; So that both the decree of God, and the actual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Gods righteouſneſſe, reaches unto all beleevers without exception. Yea, This is the true Beleevers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular portion, it belongs onely unto them; and it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily implyed in mentioning beleevers ſo reſtrictively, all beleevers, and none elſe. There are two branches of the Point.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The Righteouſneſs of God is appointed before time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all beleevers; this may be cleared by theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Whomſoever God chooſeth, hee chooſeth unto Faith, Act. 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life, beleeved.</hi> All beleevers then were formerly ordained unto life, and the ſtate of Juſtification is a ſtate of Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. Hence it is that true faith is called, <hi>The Faith of Gods Elect,</hi> Tit. 1.1. Gods Elect have a peculiar kinde of faith that none others have, but they.</p>
            <p>Beſides, all Gods Elect <hi>(Capable of it)</hi> muſt needs have it; for if any of Gods Elect did want it, it could not rightly bee ſo called, Joh. 6.37. <hi>All that my Father gives mee ſhall come unto mee, and him that comes unto mee, I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> and hee expounds comming by beleeving, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. and the giving any unto Chriſt is their Election from Eternity. Now mark that hee ſaith, <hi>All that the Father gives mee, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Juſtification, or Gods Righteouſneſſe, is appointed only to Beleevers. It is of mighty conſideration which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith, Joh. 10.26, 27. <hi>Ye beleeve not, becauſe yee are not of my ſheep.</hi> Our Saviour had Preached moſt powerfully, and done many Miracles among the people, yet they beleeved not, and hee ſhews the reaſon of it, becauſe they were not of his ſheep, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as were elected, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15. Such as are known of Chriſt in a peculiar manner, and hee had laid down his life for. What then, hath not <hi>Iſrael</hi> obtained what hee ſought for? Rom. 11.7. <hi>The Election hath obtained it, the rest were hardened.</hi> When perſons are hardned, and beleeve
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:168555:120"/>not, they are the <hi>reſt</hi> that are not of the Election.</p>
            <p>The reaſons of this branch are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the nature of Election, which is the Lords chuſing to the mean, as well as to the end of eternal ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now the imputation of the ſatisfaction and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, apprehended by faith, is the neceſſary means of ſalvation. It is the order in all reaſonable Agents, that firſt they intend the end, then the means to that end. But the Lord doth with one ſingle act intend both, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>He hath choſen you to Salvation through ſanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the truth.</hi> Tit. 3.7. <hi>That being juſtified by his grace, wee might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</hi> Rom. 8.30. <hi>Whom hee juſtifies, them hee glorifies.</hi> No juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation without faith, no faith without imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no glorification without juſtification.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How are Infants juſtified, who have no faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I will not trouble you with that Controverſie, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving things unrevealed, to the Lord; without doubt hee hath his ways of applying righteouſneſſe unto them, though wee know it not, neither doth it ſo much concern us: the Lord in the Scriptures ſpeaks to them that are of age, and among them none ſhall be ſaved, but ſuch as lay hold upon imputed righteouſneſſe by faith. As when he ſaith, <hi>He that will not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall not eat,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3.10. who will apply this to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants? So that, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3, 5, 10. <hi>Except yee repent, yee ſhall periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. From our election in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.4. the meaning whereof is.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That God the Father hath choſen us in Chriſt as the Head, that he may be the head of all the Elect, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of thoſe good things, which are made over to them in their election. That is the meaning of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. when as Chriſt Jeſus is ſaid to be the Head of thoſe that ſhall bee ſaved.</p>
            <p n="2">2 In as much as Chriſt made manifeſt in the fleſh, ſhed his bloud for the ſins of the elect, and fulfilled all righteouſneſſe for them, and made the way to eternal glory open to them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In as much as the Elect doe apprehend him, and his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:168555:121"/>righteouſneſſe and ſatisfaction by faith, and by it are ingrafted into him, as branches into a true vine, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. and brought to the poſſeſſion of all thoſe good things, which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for them.</p>
            <p>But the meaning of the place is not, that we are choſen <hi>for Chriſt,</hi> or that Chriſt Jeſus was the cauſe of the Fathers ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of us, but rather, that we are choſen to be <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> and being in Chriſt are made partakers of his ſatisfaction, and righteouſneſſe, which are made ours by faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Branch. <hi>That Gods righteouſneſſe is imputed and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on all true beleevers, without difference, and none others,</hi> Rom. 4.11. <hi>Abraham</hi> is the Father of Beleevers, or all them that beleeve; that righteouſneſſe might bee imputed to them alſo; That look as <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. <hi>and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe:</hi> ſo it is with all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they are juſtified by the ſame means, and have righteouſneſſe imputed to them. Hence it is called the <hi>Righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> Rom. 4.13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. that is, the righteouſneſſe <hi>apprehended,</hi> and <hi>appropriated</hi> to beleevers by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the law, &amp;c. to every one that beleeveth,</hi> i. e. to every one without exception, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.39. <hi>By him all that beleeve, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. by Chriſt, through whom is preached <hi>the forgiveneſſe of ſins;</hi> and ſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. whoſoever beleeveth on him, hath the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed; and for the contrary, ſee <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18, 36.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. From the equality of the eſtate of beleevers, there is no difference in regard of ſin, in their Natural eſtate, and this reaſon is given, <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>All have ſinned, &amp;c.</hi> therefore where they are juſtified they ſtand alike in need of imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, the ſame being imputed to all; neither is there any difference in regard of the truth of apprehending the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt by faith: all true beleevers having the like precious faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. now the old rule is, that <hi>where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual things are added to equal, all are equal ſtill.</hi> Their miſery is equal, their faith is equal, their imputed righteouſneſſe is equal, therefore there is no difference.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe that God is one, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.30. there is one God that juſtifies the Circumciſion by faith, and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:168555:121"/>through faith. Hee proves, that whether Jewes or Gentiles, they are equally juſtified, becauſe there is but one God juſtifies both; he means, not only one God in regard of eſſence, but one in regard of his will and promiſe. So God is one and the ſame from the beginning to the end of the world, and if hee ſhould deal in a differing way with them, in point of Juſtification, he ſhould not bee free from partiality, and accepting of mens perſons; but that is farre from God, for an equal price is paid for all, and equal ſatisfaction to Gods Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe all unbeleevers, or miſ-beleevers, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from this grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. becauſe they have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved on the Name of the only begotten Son of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are condemned, and left deſtitute of this imputed righteouſneſſe. The dignity of the perſon, and all-ſufficiency of his ſatisfaction, and righteouſneſſe, the preciouſneſſe of the Name of the Son of God, and alſo the Promiſes made in him, doe all concur to the aggravation of the Sin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and hold unbeleevers in the ſtate of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Righteouſneſſe being thus appointed and imputed to all true beleevers, and to them only, wee may then here ſee a refutation of two errors.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Of thoſe that affirm a man to bee juſtified before faith, and from eternity, which is an opinion contended for in theſe dayes; and appears to be falſe for theſe reaſons. 1 Becauſe no man can be ſaid to beleeve from eternity, and no man is juſtified before he beleeves. No man beleeves before his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, wherein faith is wrought, after which his juſtification follows, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30, 32. as Glorification, and election unto glory doe differ, ſo juſtification, and election to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion differ, ſo that although the elect are <hi>appointed</hi> to juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before faith, yet they are not <hi>juſtified,</hi> Rom. 8.29. A Sinner cannot be glorified from eternity, unleſſe wee will take up the error of <hi>Himeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.17, 18. that ſaid the Reſurrection was already paſt. 3 Juſtification from eternity denies the Scripture, that ſaith in divers places, that a ſtate of ſin, wrath, and guilt goe before the ſtate of juſtification and forgiveneſſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:168555:122"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.25, 26. Many other things might bee urged to this purpoſe, but my deſign now is not to enter on the handling of Controverſies.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The other error is, that faith fore-ſeen, is the moving cauſe of the election of Beleevers, whereas imputation of righteouſneſſe and faith, are fruits of election, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.8. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. A ground of unſpeakable terrour to all unbeleevers, and ſuch as are deſtitute of juſtifying faith; only <hi>[by unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers]</hi> I mean thoſe that live under the Goſpel preached, and faithfully diſpenſed, and continue ſtill in unbelief. Many there be that think it a matter of bravery to ſtand out under a faithful Miniſtry, againſt the offers of Chriſt, in their pride, covetouſneſſe, and unbelief, and ſlight the ſatisfaction and righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, as if they were not worth a taking up, or looking after. What ſhall I ſay to ſuch? truly this I will ſay, that they are <hi>Goſpel</hi> unbeleevers. And though I would not enter into Gods ſecrets, yet undoubted it is, that God's purpoſe of election, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. can never bee fruſtrate, but muſt take effect in Gods time, and thoſe that are choſen to faith and juſtification, ſhall beleeve, and be juſtified under the means; but what ſhall become of the reſt? Why they are the more blinded, and hardned by the means, and grow worſe and worſe, and never beleeve, and never are juſtified, and therefore were never elected. For the love of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, that obdurate, and continued unbelief under the means of Grace, is a very Brand-mark of a Reprobate, Dreadful is that place, 2 <hi>Co.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that be loſt, in whom the god of this world hath blinded the eyes of them that beleeve not.</hi> And remember, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.26.</p>
            <p>Obj. 1. <hi>But ſuch as theſe have many good parts, good know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, judgement, memory, skill in Arts and Tongues, Orthodox in Religion, yea it may bee juſt in their dealings, live peaceably with their neighbours, repair to Ordinances diligently, full of good works of mercy, courteous, and loving in their behaviour, &amp;c. will you not ſay that ſuch as theſe are elected?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This I will ſay, that theſe things will not prove to our hearts, that we are gone beyond the ſtate of Reprobates. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God.</hi>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:168555:122"/>Righteouſneſs is unto all, and upon all that beleeve, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on none elſe: though Parts, Gifts, outward conformity, and many other natural and moral Excellencies, may bee in whom Chriſts righteouſneſs is not, witneſſe <hi>Judas,</hi> the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and others.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>But God can do much, and ſave mee at laſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But thou muſt look to the ordinary and ordinate power of God, which works ſuitably to his will, yea his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will: and that is not to ſave but by faith. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. True, the abſolute power of God can do much, but it doth not croſs his ſecret determination, or revealed purpoſe for end or means; and God hath ſworn, that an unbeleever ſhall not enter into his reſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.11, 18. and is it poſſible God ſhould be forſworn?</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But many gracious Promiſes are made by God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> See for that, Heb. 4.1, 2. <hi>And fear leſt a Promiſe being made, &amp;c. you come ſhort of it, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But I may beleeve hereafter, and ſo have Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs imputed to me, and this will be an evidence of Gods Election in me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will not deny that: for otherwiſe it were clear that thou art a reprobate, and the Goſpel ſhould no more be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to thee, than to the Devils: But let mee tell thee thus much, it is a very ſad condition for any one long to ſtand out under powerful means in unbeleef, and a deadly Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome. As it is in a diſeaſe wherein the ſtrongeſt medicines have been applyed, yet work no cure, but the diſeaſe grows worſe and worſe; It is a ſtrong preſumption, that ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe will never bee healed. Jerem. 51.9. <hi>Wee would have heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Babylon, <hi>but ſhee is not healed, forſake her,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 29.1. <hi>Hee then being often reproved, &amp;c.</hi> The Jews among whom our Saviour had Preached, and wrought many miracles, beleeved not, becauſe <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had ſaid, <hi>Hee hath blinded their eies, &amp;c. Joh.</hi> 12.37, 39. So it is with ſome that ſtand out long under the means, that they are blinded, and hardened to their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: However it is a grievous condition, for any poor ſoul to live in the want of the comfort of Gods eternal election, as every unbeleever doth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. It is unſpeakable comfort to a true Beleever. Hee
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:168555:123"/>may hence undoubtedly conclude theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That Chriſts righteouſneſs is imputed to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That hee is eternally elected.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That hee ſhall never loſe his faith, or the righteouſneſſe received.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That hee is no leſs juſtified or righteous than any of the faithful from the beginning.</p>
            <p>It is true, a weaker meaſure of faith, doth <hi>leſs firmly</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this benefit: but it doth as <hi>truely</hi> belong to one beleever, as another; and there is a double certainty, one of the <hi>Object,</hi> and as in the particulars named, 2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure;</hi> And there is a certainty of the <hi>Subject,</hi> that is, the Minde and Heart of the Beleever, this is often ſhaken in the Faithful with Doubts and Fears, and Carnal Cavils; but it is to bee ſtriven againſt; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that beleeves in Truth, and knows it, ought as certainly to conclude with himſelf that his ſins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, and righteouſneſs is imputed unto him, as hee ought certainly, to beleeve the Goſpel, or God in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. <hi>John</hi> 3.33. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. And as it is certain, ſo it is unchangeable, the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it, Chriſt hath prayed that it fail not. <hi>Luke</hi> 20.22, 23.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, There is no difference, all have righteouſneſſe alike, that is the one robe, that ſerves to cover one, and all the reſt of the members of Chriſt. <hi>By the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one, the free gift came upon all, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 5.18. The weakeſt Beleever is as Righteous before God, as <hi>Paul, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> This Righteouſneſſe is not imputed to ſome more, and to ſome leſſe; but as the Sun ſhines alike to all, that have eies to ſee it, or to all upon whom it is riſen: So alſo the Sun of righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 4. Exhort. To every one then to thruſt in amongſt the crowd of true Beleevers, and to labour to be in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, to give diligence to make your calling and election ſure. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. Make firſt your calling ſure, which is done when ſaith is wrought, and then you need not climbe into Heaven to know whether you are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Juſtification and Salvation. Do but look into
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:168555:123"/>your own hearts, whither you have faith without Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. that is faith without <hi>reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> hypocriſy; but here you had need of ſome Cautions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caut.</hi> 1. Cozen not your ſelves with preſumption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of faith, as the moſt Profeſſors do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caut.</hi> 2 Look not at all true faith, as that which is juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is a true faith, a man may make <hi>Ship-wrack</hi> of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. but that cannot bee ſaid of Juſtifying Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caut.</hi> 3. See that wee do not make an Idol of Faith, as though it had any inward virtue in it ſelf to juſtify a ſinner before God; For this were to make the Righteouſneſſe of God in vain: for to bee juſtified by faith, is no more than to bee juſtified by Chriſt, and they are ſpoken promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16, 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caut.</hi> 4. That wee do not bring a faith of our own mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; true faith is of the operation of God. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. and it is not in the Creatures power to make it: but ſee thy inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to beleeve, and unworthineſs too, that God ſhould ever work it in thee, eſpecially in regard of thy ſleighting Chriſt, and grace, many a time, when it hath been offered to thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caut.</hi> 5. Look not at that as true faith, wherewith we can bee content to ſtand at a <hi>diſtance</hi> from Chriſt. Beleeving on Chriſt is <hi>comming</hi> to him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.13. A beleever will get as near Chriſt as poſſibly hee can; that Chriſt <hi>may dwell in his heart, Eph.</hi> 3.17. but on the contrary, it is very dreadful, when as the ſoul runs away from Chriſt, and his People, and Ordinances, and can rejoyce when hee is furtheſt from Communion with him, or can be content with behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt afar off, or conceit he hath enough of Chriſt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this is to bee far from Chriſt and from beleeving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caut.</hi> 6. Take heed that we bar not our ſelves out from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſſe, by inventing or pleading ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, diſtinction or difference, to exclude us, as to ſay, that it is the greatneſs and multitude of our ſins, ſhall hinder us, or the imperfection of our duties and ſervices, or the little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our humiliation, or the fewneſſe of our good works,

               <hi>declaration</hi> of his righteouſneſs, which is mentioned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated as a principal matter, that the Spirit of God would have us take notice of, the which is amplified,</p>
            <p>Firſt, by an <hi>Exegoſis, or Explication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, By the <hi>adjunct of time;</hi> to declare at this time, &amp;c. This latter remains to be ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is meant by the Righteouſneſs of God here?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is needful to bee opened, becauſe it is certain that Righteouſneſſe is aſcribed to God in ſeveral reſpects, and ſignifications;
<note place="margin">Righteouſneſs of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taken four waies.</note> Divines do uſually reduce them to four ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Juſtice or Righteouſneſs of God, doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify his <hi>Rectitude,</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> as it is oppoſed to <hi>ſin, Pſalm</hi> 11. verſ. the laſt, the <hi>Righteous Lord loves righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, his countenance doth behold the juſt.</hi> It was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, verſ. 5. <hi>The Lord tryeth the Righteous, but the wicked his ſoul hates, &amp;c.</hi> This is uſually called <hi>univerſal Juſtice,</hi> and comprehends all virtues, or moral perfections in it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is taken for the <hi>Mercy, Goodneſs, bounty of God,</hi> whereby hee beſtows many benefits on his Creatures, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith to <hi>Iſrael, Let mee reaſon with you of the Righteous Acts of the Lord, which the Lord did in</hi> Egypt, <hi>ſending</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>to them, and bringing them out of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: and in the 45. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. <hi>The Lord raiſeth up</hi> Cyrus <hi>in Righteouſneſſe, that hee ſhould build up</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and let go the Captives;</hi> and his thus ſending of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and raiſing up of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> were ſignal Acts of his Mercy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Righteouſneſſe of God ſignifies his <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>conſtancy,</hi> in keeping his Word, and fulfilling his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: 1 Joh. 1.19. <hi>If wee confeſs our ſins, hee is juſt and faithful to forgive, &amp;c.</hi> Not that hee will forgive meerly for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of them, as if there were any thing in the Act of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to <hi>deſerve</hi> forgiveneſs, but 'tis becauſe hee is faithfull, hee hath promiſed to forgive them, and ſo will bee as good as his word: Iſa. 45.19. <hi>I ſaid not unto the ſeed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſeek yee mee in vain, I the Lord speak Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, this I have promiſed, and I will do it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Gods Righteouſneſs ſignifies that <hi>perfection</hi> of God, whereby hee diſtributes to every one according to their
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:168555:125"/>works, rewarding the godly, and puniſhing the wicked, Pſal. 9.7, 8. <hi>The Lord hath prepared his Throne for Judgement, and hee ſhall judge the world in righteouſneſs;</hi> The Lord is there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as the Judge of all the World, and ſo judging righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly every perſon: So alſo the Word is taken, Rom. 1.32. <hi>Who knowing the righteous judgement of God, that they that do ſuch things are worthy of death,</hi> and the word is rendred <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies righteous Judgement: and that is to puniſh with death them that are worthy of it. <hi>Nahum</hi> 1.2-6. So Jerem. 51.56. <hi>The Lord God of recompence ſhall ſurely requite you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not further inlarge this, but ſtill the Queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, which of theſe waies the righteouſneſſe of God is tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in this place? for it is manifeſt, that the righteouſneſſe of God, is in all theſe reſpects evidenced in the Juſtification of a ſinner; for,</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is the Truth and Faithfulneſſe of God: Luk. 1.69, 70. <hi>Hee hath viſited us, as hee spake by the mouth of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. So Act. 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, His Mercy and Goodneſſe doth appear in our Juſtification; This <hi>David</hi> hath recourſe unto in Pſal. 51.1, 2. <hi>Bee merciful unto mee, and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out mine iniquities:</hi> But I conceive the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth intend onely the firſt and laſt ſenſe, for they are not contrary (I mean Gods rectitude, and his diſtributive, or his relative, and vindictive juſtice) but are co-ordinate, and the one doth infer the other, but eſpecially his vindictive ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is meant in the Text; and this appears, firſt, becauſe the Apoſtle had mentioned before, both his Grace, and Free grace in the forgiveneſs of our ſins, and alſo the imputation of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. and his Truth too, verſ. the 21. This was teſtified in the Law, and the Prophets; therefore now he ſpeaks of another diſtinct Attribute of God, namely his Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Apoſtle addes ſeveral Expreſſions to ſignify this, as firſt, hee ſaith, <hi>that hee might bee juſt,</hi> and the <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> they are Conjugates, and relate to the proper meaning of the word, <hi>Juſtice,</hi> which is, <hi>ſuum cui<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> tribuere; [The Juſtifier
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:168555:126"/>of him,</hi> that is, of <hi>man,</hi> who is unjuſt.] So that the Apoſtles meaning is, the Lord juſtifies a ſinner in a way of Juſtice. Secondly, Hee ſaith that God would declare his Juſtice in the way that hee propoſes, for the ſinners Juſtification. Thirdly, Hee doubles, the words <hi>(to declare his Righteouſneſs)</hi> implying this, that God would have us to take ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it: for it is as much as if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, there is not onely <hi>Mercy and Truth</hi> in a ſinners juſtification; but there is alſo <hi>Juſtice</hi> in it; The Lord declareth his juſtice in this thing; and therefore it is that the Father ſet forth Chriſt to bee a Propitiation, that hee might declare his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: If the Lord had ſaid, Well, ye are great and grievous ſinners, I am content to forgive you all your ſins, this would have declared the grace of God: But when hee ſaith alſo, that this is through the redemption that is in Chriſt, and that hee hath ſet forth Chriſt to bee a Propitiation, and that the blood of Chriſt was ſhed for thy ſins, this doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as much as his Truth and Grace. Fourthly, There is another expreſſion to this purpoſe <hi>(To declare I ſay at this time)</hi> what is that? but in the times of the Goſpel, ſince that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſhed his blood; for though the Juſtice of God, was but darkly ſignified in the Old Teſtament; by the Types of the Sacrifices, and puniſhments inflicted; yet it was far more clearly held forth by the Death of Chriſt, and that <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace was on him.</hi> Fifthly, Adde to all theſe the like phraſe uſed in other Scriptures, declaring the juſtice of God, 2 Theſſ. 1.5, 6. <hi>Which is a manifeſt token of the righteous judgement of God, &amp;c.</hi> and verſ. 6. <hi>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them that trouble you:</hi> here we have the ſame phraſe uſed &amp; applyed to Gods diſtributive, &amp; revenging juſtice, and more plainly the ſame word is uſed, Phil. 1.28. <hi>And in nothing terrified by our adverſaries,</hi> and there the word is tranſlated <hi>a manifeſt token,</hi> and ſo it is here, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt token of demonſtration, and ſure proof of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God, that hee juſtifies a ſinner in ſuch a way, by the ſacrifice and ſatisfaction of his Son. The Points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin then ariſing from hence, are theſe following.</p>
            <p>Doctr. 1. <hi>Not onely the exact truth of God, or the abundance of his Grace, but alſo his ſtrict Juſtice doth concur to the Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſinner in the ſight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:168555:126"/>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>That the glory of Gods Juſtice, and the manifeſt proof therof to the World in the death of Chriſt, is the great end of the grace, that the Lord ſhews forth in the Juſtification of Beleevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Concerning the firſt of theſe,
<note place="margin">The ſtrict ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God doth concur to the juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſinner.</note> 
               <hi>That not onely the exact truth of God, or the abundance of his Grace, but alſo his ſtrict Juſtice doth concur to the Juſtification of a ſinner in Gods ſight.</hi> Or thus, God is not onely true, and merciful, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo juſt in the juſtification of a finner. I need not now inſiſt upon that, that the Truth and Mercy of God do ſhine, and appear in this thing, I have ſpoken to that formerly; onely I ſhall lay before your confideration ſome Scriptures, and in a few words paſs it over, Mic. 7.18. to 20. <hi>Who is a God like to thee, that pardoneſt their Iniquity? &amp;c.</hi> There hee ſpeaks of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, in which work God is exalted above all the world; But why doth God forgive ſin? becauſe (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>hee delights in mercy,</hi> it is his bleſſed will and pleaſure to ſhew mercy, but hee addes alſo, <hi>thou wilt perform thy truth to</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, <hi>and thy mercy to</hi> Abraham, <hi>which thou haſt ſworn to our Fathers in the daies of old.</hi> In which place wee have mention made both of Gods truth, in keeping his promſe, and his Oath which hee ingaged himſelf in, to <hi>Abraham</hi> from the daies of old, and alſo his mercy in making and keeping ſuch a weighty promiſe; ſo <hi>Zachary</hi> praiſing God for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.72. hath theſe words, viz. <hi>To perform his mercy promiſed, and to remember his holy Covenant,</hi> there is his mercy in ſending his Son to purchaſe forgiveneſs, and his truth in performing the Mercy promiſed; and theſe are generally granted, and acknowledged on all ſides; but the Text addes, <hi>Moreover, that hee may bee juſt, and ſhew his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe</hi> therein; and this is alſo cleared in ſeveral places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; and the truth hereof appears,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Firſt, By all the Sacrifices of the Law, which were offered up for the pacifying of Gods Anger, and they all ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified this, that <hi>without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion;</hi> Heb. 9.22. and how comes it to paſs that there was no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin in the Old Teſtament, without ſhedding of blood in a Ceremonial way? Surely, this was to ſhew that Gods juſtice required ſome expiation of ſin; to bee made, in a way of <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for ſin, even in thoſe times, and to turn
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:168555:127"/>the eies of Gods people to Chriſts death, whereby juſtice might bee fully ſatisfied, and it is obſervable what is added, ver. 23, 24 <hi>It was therefore neceſſary that the patterns of the things in the heavens ſhould be purified with theſe,</hi> but the heavenly things themſelves with better ſacrifices than theſe. Where by the patterns of the heavenly things, are to bee underſtood the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the Law, which typified Goſpel Myſteries, and by the heavenly things, the Spiritual graces, more plentifully poured forth in the dayes of the New Teſtament. Now all are purified with Sacrifices, and our ſacrifice under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is farre better than theirs; and mark how he ſaith, that it was neceſſary that all purification ſhould bee thus wrought, he doth not only ſay that it was comely to bee ſo, or convenient for orders ſake, or mercies ſake, but <hi>it was neceſſary,</hi> not only by reaſon of Gods Decree to juſtifie and ſave ſome, but ſin being pre-ſuppoſed, and God purpoſing to juſtifie and ſave a ſmall remnant, it was neceſſary, and that becauſe of the Juſtice of God, that there ſhould be ſuch a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin, and ſo eſpecially I conceive thoſe words, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.26. are to bee underſtood, <hi>Ought not Chriſt to ſuffer ſuch things?</hi> And in verſ. 28. <hi>The Son of Man muſt bee delivered into the hands of ſinful men, and bee crucified, &amp;c.</hi> there was a neceſſity of it, or elſe all the world of Mankind muſt periſh, and be condemned, and that becauſe of the juſtice of God: and if we doe but conſider the way and manner of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and forgiveneſſe, wee ſhall ſee that it muſt needs bee in a way of juſtice. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1 It was by the <hi>not ſparing of his own Son,</hi> Rom. 8.32. Chriſt was Gods own natural and eternal Son, and though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, yet now being make undertaker for ſin, he could not be ſpared, the meaning is, God would not ſpare this Son of his, nor remit the leaſt ſtroke of the puniſhment. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter illuſtration of this, let us ſuppoſe ſome Malefactor be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of a Capital crime before an earthly Judge, if the Judge ſhall Sentence him to death, this is according to <hi>Juſtice;</hi> but if the Judges own Son ſhould bee charged with ſuch a Crime, and the Judge ſhould condemn him in the gate, this is <hi>exact juſtice</hi> indeed; but the ſeverity and exactneſſe of Juſtice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears much more in the ſufferings of Chriſt, for there was
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:168555:127"/>never ſuch an own Son as Chriſt; yea conſider the degree and kind of puniſhment required to bee inflicted upon this only Son, it was, that hee was made an <hi>expiation for ſin, A Curſe for us,</hi> that hee endured the pains of the Second Death, and this was as much as Juſtice in its exactneſſe required, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Beſides this, conſider that place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Father, if it bee poſſible, let this Cup paſſe, &amp;c. But if not, thy will bee done, &amp;c.</hi> and it is ſaid, <hi>He fell on his face and prayed, &amp;c.</hi> that is, he prayed with great earneſtneſſe, and reverence, and although Chriſt <hi>was heard in what hee feared,</hi> yet the text, and the event ſhews, the cup did not paſſe, yea that it was not <hi>poſſible;</hi> becauſe ſuppoſing Chriſt to bee the Surety, by the Fathers, and Chriſt his own appointment, and Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the Juſtification of the Elect, it was not poſſible the Cup ſhould paſſe away, and that becauſe of the Juſtice of God.</p>
            <p>Obj. 1. <hi>But you will ſay, Why may not the Lord freely forgive whatſoever ſin he pleaſeth, and that of his free mercy and grace, as a man may doe, though there be no ſatisfaction to Juſtice at all, can a ſinfull man do it, and cannot the Lord do it much more?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe Juſtice is one of Gods <hi>Eſſential</hi> Attributes, ſo that he is denied to be God, if he bee denied to bee juſt; hence <hi>Paul</hi> reaſons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? God forbid, for then how ſhould God judge the world?</hi> this is to thruſt God out of his Judgement Seat. Hence it is, that there is no work of God that hee doth to Mankind at any time, but there muſt needs be an act of Juſtice in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.17. <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his wayes,</hi> therefore if he pardon ſin, he muſt doe it in a way of righteouſneſſe, and if he puniſh ſin, he muſt doe it in a way of righteouſneſſe, this he doth by the neceſſity of his nature; It is moſt certain, this righteouſneſſe of Gods nature is eternal, and ſin is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in time, but this being ſuppoſed that ſin is committed, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that a juſt God muſt puniſh it.</p>
            <p>Obj. 2. <hi>But with what puniſhment muſt he puniſh it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Anſwer, look into <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. <hi>who knowing the Judgement of God, &amp;c.</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies the righteouſneſſe of God: In this anſwer of the Apoſtle, there are three things to be noted; Firſt, That this is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally known, even by the very Heathens that he ſpeaks of, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:168555:128"/>whoſe wickedneſſe he deſcribes before; even they by the light of nature, and the workings of their own Conſciences, do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the juſtice of God. Secondly, That this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God is the cauſe, fountain, and rule of all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are inflicted, for thus it is deſcribed, <hi>that they that commit ſuch things, are worthy of death, and that the wages of ſin is death,</hi> yea, even <hi>eternal death.</hi> Thirdly, this is natural and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to God; for though, in reſpect of the exerciſe of it, it is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by men, or devils, yet in reſpect of the <hi>foundation and root</hi> of it, the Divine perfection, or Gods bleſſed nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. Now for the Objection.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>If a man can forgive a trespaſs committed againſt him, then God can without ſatisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It follows not: for, firſt a man forgives <hi>wrong</hi> done unto him; but to forgive <hi>ſin</hi> without ſatisfaction, is another matter; for <hi>ſin</hi> hurts an univerſal good. Secondly, It is one thing for a <hi>private perſon</hi> to forgive the offence, and another thing for a <hi>publick perſon,</hi> as a Judge; if a Judge forgives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſatisfaction, hee ſins againſt his office, and calling; now <hi>ſhall not the Judge of all the world do right?</hi> Thirdly, a mans juſtice is not eſſential, hee may bee a man, though unjuſt, but Gods juſtice is himſelf. Fourthly, a man is ſubject to a Law, but God is a Law to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>If God puniſh ſin naturally, and neceſſarily, then hee muſt puniſh ſin to the utmoſt of his power, as fire burns: but God doth not ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This follows not: for that neceſſity whereby God puniſheth ſin, requires not that hee ſhould puniſh ſin as much as he <hi>can,</hi> but as much as is <hi>juſt;</hi> for God doth not act as ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creatures, but with underſtanding and will, with <hi>liberty</hi> accompanying his actions, Eph. 1.11. <hi>Hee worketh all things after the counſel of his own will:</hi> thus you ſee how the juſtice of God, being the very nature of God, it muſt needs act in the juſtification of a ſinner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The ſame may bee cleared by the infinite holineſſe and purity of God, which is likewiſe one of his divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. <hi>Thou art a God of purer eies than to behold iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.2. God cannot behold ſin with an eye of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, but when hee looks upon it, it is with an angry
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:168555:128"/>and revenging eye, Pſal. 5.4, 5. <hi>Thou art not a God that haſt pleaſure in wickedneſs;</hi> God hates ſin naturally and neceſſarily, therefore hee muſt puniſh it either in the Sinner or the Surety, according to the demerit of it. Exod. 31.7. <hi>He will by no means acquit the guilty,</hi> though hee bee moſt merciful to thoſe that are in Chriſt, in whom his juſtice is ſatisfied, yet hee irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilably hates, and abhors all ſuch as are guilty, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.4. <hi>Do not this abominable thing that I hate,</hi> hee cannot acquit them, or free them from puniſhment, but hee muſt violate his own nature, therefore hee muſt needs condemn and puniſh them, and whomſoever hee juſtifies, it is upon the ground of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his juſtice, in and by Chriſt on their behalf; and thus you ſee there muſt needs be juſtice in the pardon of them, becauſe he is unchangeably holy.</p>

Hee doth neceſſarily impoſe, and exact obedience at the hands of reaſonable creatures, and in caſe of diſobedience, hee muſt needs reduce the creature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to order, as being Judge and Law-giver. Hence are theſe places, 2 Theſſ. 1.6. <hi>It is righteous with God to recompence ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to thoſe that trouble you.</hi> Heb. 2.2. <hi>Every tranſgreſſion of the Law received a juſt recompence of reward.</hi> Jude 7.

Its rebellion againſt him, it pulls him out of his Throne, and depoſes him from it, therefore by ſome act of Government and Authority, which is exerciſed in a way of juſtice, the ſinner muſt bee brought into order: and though Gods wiſe and gracious diſpenſation, hath laid upon Chriſt the puniſhment of our ſins (I mean the ſins of the elect) yet puniſhed they muſt bee, in the ſinner or ſurety, and there can be no diſpenſation for that, without denial of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary power, and juſtice of Almighty God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Firſt uſe for <hi>Conviction and Terrour</hi> to vile ſinners
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:168555:129"/>that are out of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">It is a terrible thing to be out of Chriſt.</note> That ſeeing pardon of ſin, is not onely in a way of mercy and truth, but alſo in a way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it ſhews us what a groundleſſe deluſion they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves withall, that live in their unbeleef and impenitency, and yet hope to bee ſaved by the Mercy of God; In vain ſuch do hope for the mercy of God, yea, there is none ſo deſperately wicked, living near the means, but that upon this very ground, they ſleep ſecurely in ſin, and commit it with greedineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is ſo merciful.</p>
            <p>Now to diſcover the groſſeneſs of this deceit, conſider firſt, that though God bee <hi>infinitely merciful,</hi> yet his mercy alwaies goes together with his truth. Pſal. 86.15. <hi>Hee is plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in Mercy and Truth, i. e.</hi> as God hath abundance of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo hee is plenteous in truth; his truth is in fulfilling both his promiſes and threatnings; thou canſt not expect mercy of God, in ſuch a way as to overthrow his truth, his truth of his promiſes, Tit. 1.4. <hi>Grace, Mercy, and Peace are from God the Father, and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There is no Mercy to bee expected from God, but through Jeſus Chriſt; Luk. 1.50. <hi>His mercy is on them that fear him,</hi> they that do not fear God, have no title to his mercy; ſo there is the truth of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, that <hi>hee will not bee merciful to any wicked tranſgreſſour, Pſal.</hi> 59.5. to any one that loves his ſin, and lives in it, and refuſes to bee reformed. Gods mercy is as it were the bridge over the pit, to carry the ſoul to heaven; but a man that hath his eies, will bee careful that he tread not beſide, as upon the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of the bridge, inſtead of the bridge. Yea, it is railed (as it were) with his truth, beware of going without the rail, leſt you drop into the pit; now thoſe that we ſpeak of go with out the rail, and the promiſes, and threatnings are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: ſo they do evidently truſt in a <hi>lye,</hi> ſaying, <hi>They ſhall have Peace, &amp; Mercy, walking in the ſtubbornneſs of their own hearts,</hi> Deut. 29.19, 20. but the Lord ſaith, hee will not bee merciful to ſuch: but beſides, the great deluſion is, that they do look for pardon of ſin by meer mercy, with the wrong or denial of the juſtice of God.</p>
            <p>3 There cannot poſſibly bee any remiſſion of ſin, unleſſe that God can pardon in <hi>Juſtice</hi> as well as <hi>Mercy:</hi> There can bee no diſpenſation for this: If God could have pardoned
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:168555:129"/>ſin without the price of redemption, then certainly Chriſt dyed altogether in vain. For what? did the father ſend forth Chriſt to bee the Propitiation for ſin, to ſhew his juſtice? how can they beleeve that? if Gods juſtice did not exact the price? If the price might have been omitted without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to his juſtice? could God bee eternally juſt, if hee had not puniſhed ſin at all? Prov. 17.15. <hi>To juſtify the wicked</hi> (without ſatisfaction to juſtice) <hi>is an abomination to the Lord,</hi> and will the Lord do that which is abominable to him? will any King put his own Son to death to ſave a traitours life? when hee can freely pardon the traitour if hee will? ſurely that were an unnatural and a cruel part: and can wee think that God the Father will give up his onely begotten Son to death to ſave ſinners, when hee may out of meer grace and mercy pardon them without ſuch a ſacrifice? certainly, God would never do it.</p>
            <p>Briefly, the ſinner muſt neceſſarily ſatisfy juſtice, either by himſelf or by his ſurety: or elſe it is utterly impoſſible that his ſin ſhould bee forgiven. Heb. 10.26, 27. <hi>Without a ſacrifice for ſin, there remains nothing, but a certain fearful looking for of judgement and fiery indignation, that ſhall devour the adverſaries.</hi> Doth any ſoul expect pardon without Chriſt? then hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects peace without any ſacrifice for him, but the Text ſaith, that without this, <hi>there remains nothing but a fearful expectation, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Briefly, ſuch a hope of pardon, is interpretatively, no better than Atheiſm and denial of God. For it denies the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, it denies his purity and holineſſe, it denies his Soveraignty, yea, it denies Chriſt, if the Lord bee God, hee is juſt and holy, and Judge of all the World; and if hee bee juſt, hee cannot pardon ſin but in a way of juſtice, and that ſealed by Chriſts blood. I pray conſider, that Pſal. 89.13, 14. <hi>Thou haſt a mighty arm, strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand;</hi> conſider, what a God you have to deal withall, hee is a mighty ſtrong God, no creature is able to withſtand him, if hee bee diſpleaſed.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>I, but he is merciful too?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 89.14. Juſtice and judgement are the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of his Throne, mercy and truth ſhall go before his

            <p n="2">2 They are offered firſt, and when refuſed, Juſtice doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. So a like place, Pſal. 36.5, 6. <hi>Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the Heavens, and thy faithfulneſſe reacheth unto the Clouds,</hi> that is, there is a vaſtneſſe and immenſity in both, they are very great: but whence is his Juſtice ſo great? his righteouſneſſe is like the ſtrong mountains, &amp;c. as if hee had ſaid, the righteouſneſſe of God is as unſupportable and unmoveable as the ſtrong mountains; and his judgements they do not ſwim aloft, but they are an infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable depth: You cannot bear them, nor remove Gods righteouſneſs, nor meaſure or fathom his judgements; and thou that art a ſinner, haſt theſe mountains ready to fall upon thee, and art ſinking into this great deep; What is it that makes the Devils eternally miſerable? but that they have no Chriſt to ſatisfy the juſtice of God; and if a ſinner on earth live and dye without Chriſt, he is as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſalvation, as thoſe in the 2 of the <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 12.</p>

<note place="margin">The vile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſin diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note> That wee ſhould hereby learn to know the vile nature of ſin, and to judge aright of it, which very few are acquainted withall. Which evidently appears, both by their ſecurity when they have committed it, their cloaks and colors to hide it, and their boldneſſe in committing of it, none of which would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee, if they did underſtand what it is. Now a ſure way to diſcover it, and to remove and ſcatter all miſtakes about it, and to digeſt well this principle, that no ſin can ever bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but the courſe of Divine juſtice muſt certainly and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily paſs upon it, as ſurely as God is God, that is, as ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as God is juſt and righteous: which if hee ſhould ceaſe to bee, or but abate of it in any one act, hee ſhould ceaſe to be
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:168555:131"/>God, Rom. 3.5, 6. <hi>If God bee unrighteous, how then ſhall hee judge the World?</hi> that is, hee cannot poſſibly bee Judge of it, if hee ſhould paſs by any one ſin unpuniſhed. The day of judgement is called, Rom. 2.5. <hi>The day of the Revelation of the righteous judgements of God;</hi> Therefore no unrighteous ſentence can paſs from him. But its unrighteous to ſuffer any ſin to go unpuniſhed, though in reſpect of temporal puniſhments, God deals variouſly, as his wiſdome diſpoſes, yet hee is ever juſt, which then hee will clear to all the world, Rom. 2.2. <hi>Wee know, that the judgement of God is according unto truth,</hi> that is, as hee cannot bee deceived by any colour or pretence to hide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſin; ſo neither will hee paſs any falſe ſentence upon any action, that is to bee judged, not according to appearance, but according unto truth: nor will hee deal partially about it, for then hee ſhould not bee the God of truth; and verſ. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Hee ſhall render unto every man according to his works;</hi> that is, the nature of <hi>diſtributive juſtice:</hi> if any thing bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated of this, or leſſened, or if there ſhould bee any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the nature and eſſence of juſtice ſhould bee violated, and ſo alſo the very being of God ſhould ceaſe: beſides, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a holy God, doth hate ſin, according to his infinite holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, infinitely. God hates nothing in the world, but ſin, therefore all the infinite hatred of God is ſpent upon ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Now what a thing is that, that an infinite divine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, like a mighty undivided ſtream, ſhould with all its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forces and inundations, and deteſtation, run forceably and irreſiſtably upon every ſin, how ſmall ſoever? as <hi>vain thoughts, Prov.</hi> 15.26. and fooliſh talking, wanton glances of the eies, and the very ſecret luſts of the heart. Mince and extenuate your ſins as much as you will, yet the Lord hates every ſin as ſin, and therefore cannot chooſe but puniſh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin, little or great, according to the deſert of it, and if God ſhould hate ſin leſs than hee doth, hee ſhould ceaſe to bee God.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>How may that bee cleared?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why, if God did not hate ſin infinitely, he ſhould not bee infinitely holy, and wee ſay truely, that a thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee more or leſs infinite: whatſoever is infinite, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſo to eternity; if it ſhould bee a degree under that, it
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:168555:132"/>muſt be finite, for infinite holineſs, muſt needs bee accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with an infinite hatred of ſin. So if Gods holineſs or hatred of ſin, ſhould bee leſs than it is, it ſhould bee finite, and if infinite holineſs bee denyed to God, then his Godhead is denyed alſo. Let vile ſinners ponder this, that think and ſay many times, that Gods Miniſters ſpeak too <hi>harſhly</hi> of ſin, and hope that God is not ſo much offended, as they would make us beleeve, neither doth hee hate it ſo exceedingly.</p>
            <p>Oh poor Creatures! beware of all ſuch thoughts, if God ſhould hate ſin leſs than hee doth, hee ſhould ceaſe to be God. Oh conſider the certainty of theſe things. I beſeech you, be convinced of this, that it is a groſs and dangerous errour, to conceive that Gods mercy is greater than his juſtice; and it proceeds from the ignorance of the divine nature; for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>is in God is God,</hi> and all his attributes are infinite, and one infinite cannot bee greater than another; neither can one attribute bee contrary to another, nor exclude another, nor abate and overcome another; for how can God bee divided in himſelf? Gods mercy indeed hath a <hi>larger extent</hi> as being upon all his works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. but his diſtributive juſtice reaches onely to men and Angels, but in themſelves they are both infinite and equal.</p>
            <p>Further, for more clear demonſtration of this, that Chriſt is ſet forth to bee a Propitiation for the remiſſion of the ſins of the Elect, conſider a place, Gal. 3.13. <hi>Chriſt was made a Curſe for us,</hi> there bee two things eſpecially obſervable; Firſt, That Chriſt is called <hi>a Curſe,</hi> not only that hee that is God over all was <hi>accurſed</hi> for the ſins of the Elect imputed; but a <hi>Curſe,</hi> that (being the abſtract) comprehends the confluence and colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all the Curſes due to their ſins, none excepted: there is a curſe due to every ſin of every Elect ſoul, and they all <hi>meet</hi> upon Chriſt; But ſecondly, it was ſaid, hee was <hi>made</hi> a Curſe; by whom was hee made? but by God the Father? by the moſt loving Father, though the moſt loving and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son, though hee did alwaies thoſe things that pleaſed him. <hi>Joh</hi> 8.29. Yet ſuch a Father made ſuch a Son to bee accurſt: that is, not onely forſook him, ſo that for the time hee had no ſenſe of the preſence of Gods grace and favour towards him: but filled him brim-full (as it were) with the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:168555:132"/>ſenſe of his fierce indignation due to his peoples ſins. What manner of Juſtice is this in God the Father (beloved in the Lord) that dealt thus with a holy Son, and ſuch a Son? whatſoever might ſtay the hand of Juſtice from proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, was found in Chriſt, yet nothing could prevail. I may adde that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Conſider him that indured ſuch contradiction, &amp;c.</hi> mark the words how emphatical, <hi>him,</hi> ſtanding in ſuch relation unto God, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Queſt. <hi>What evil is there in ſin that Divine Justice ſhould ſo purſue it, and that God cannot paſſe it by, except that Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice doe proceed againſt it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

<note place="margin">Sin is oppoſite to Gods nature which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved divers ways.</note> and ſo is nothing in the world but ſin; of other things it is moſt true that is ſaid. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>Of him, and through him, and for him, are all things,</hi> but it cannot be ſaid ſo of ſin, for hee is no cauſe of it, neither hath he any influence into it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. the Fleſh and Spirit in a Child of God are contrary one to another, that is, the regenerate and unregenerate part, but theſe are <hi>contraries remiſſe;</hi> but contraries in the <hi>higheſt degrees</hi> can never bee reconciled together, therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14, 15. What fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe? <hi>what communion hath light with darkneſſe, or what concord hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> God is perfect righteouſneſſe and light, <hi>and in him is no darkneſſe at all,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. Sin is unrighteouſneſſe, and darkneſſe that hath no light in it, therefore what fellowſhip or communion can there be betwixt theſe? hee means none at all, it is againſt the nature and being of all things; now if there can be no communion, then no juſtification; for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:168555:133"/>is part of a ſinners communion with God, therefore juſtification doth neceſſarily require puniſhment and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; for without this the Law remains in force, and the <hi>Law is the ſtrength of ſin,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.56. and ſin in the <hi>full ſtrength</hi> of it, is ſtrongly oppoſite to God. And mark theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Job</hi> 34.10-13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.3.4. <hi>Moſes</hi> there calls for audience, and ſo doe I, and as he begins his ſpeech, ſo may I alſo ſay upon this occaſion, <hi>Give ear O heavens, and I will ſpeak; and hear O earth the words of my mouth, &amp;c.</hi> Hee ſummons the unreaſonable Creatures to give attention to what he was about to ſpeak, and what was it? <hi>I will publiſh the name of the Lord, aſcribe yee greatneſſe to our God. Hee is the rock, his work is perfect, all his ways are judgement, a God of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is he:</hi> he proves God to be the Rock, and God of truth, or the true God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is without iniquity, and all his works are without ſin; whence it follows, that if there were the leaſt ſin in God, or done by God, he could not then bee the Rock, his wayes would not bee perfect, nor could hee bee ſtiled juſt and right, or the God of truth. Hence it may bee thus reaſoned, That muſt needs bee extreamly evil, which if it were in the leaſt degree in God, would inſtantly take away his being. But ſuch an evil is ſin, &amp;c.

            <p>Queſt. <hi>How may it appear that ſin is oppoſite to the nature of God?</hi> This is a great matter to be cleared, and if we beleeve that there is a God, and ſuch a God as the Scripture deſcribes, then wee may know him by the contrary, <hi>Contraria juxta ſe poſita magis eluceſcunt.</hi>

Sin is darkneſſe without any light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>That in his fleſh there dwells no good thing;</hi> that is, in his corrupt nature. If wee doe conſider other things, ſuch as affliction, death, and the like, theſe have ſome good in them, and are the works of God; the Devil himſelf hath ſome good in him, for the Angelical nature is the good Creature of God; that therefore muſt needs bee extreamly bad, that is worſe than the Devil; ſo for Hell, we think it to be very bad, but that is kindled by the breath of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. laſt; but we cannot ſpeak ſo of ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The workings of ſin doe prove it to be oppoſite to God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The wiſdome of the fleſh,</hi> i. e. The beſt thing that is in an unregenerate man, &amp;c. it is not only an <hi>enemy,</hi> but <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi> whatſoever is in the nature of enmity is found in fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdome: the fleſhly wiſe ones are the greateſt enemies to God; and though ſuch have goodly pretences oftentimes of the greateſt love of God, yet God accounts them to bee ſuch as hate him: hee looks upon ſinners under no other notion but as his deſperate enemies, that bear a deadly hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Thus you have it expreſt in the ſecond Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>I will viſit the ſins of them that hate me;</hi> you would account it a fearful accuſation to charge you with hatred of God, and yet it is ſo indeed, if you are in your natural eſtate, for the Lord terms you <hi>Haters of him,</hi> and he calls things by their right names: And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. amongſt other vile things which hee
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:168555:134"/>chargeth them with, Hee ſaith they <hi>were haters of God;</hi> and hence it is that the Scripture frequently aſcribes that to wicked men, which argues the greateſt hatred, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Their tongue and their doings are againſt the Lord to provoke the eyes of his glory:</hi> all that a ſinner ſpeaks or doth, is againſt the Lord: <hi>Hee ſtrives againſt God,</hi> Iſa. 45.8. <hi>Woe bee to him that ſtriveth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Maker; hee fights againſt God,</hi> Job 15.25. hee ſtretcheth out his hand, and ſtrengtheneth himſelf againſt the Almighty. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. One would think it had been a very ſmall ſin that <hi>Saul</hi> committed in ſparing <hi>Agag,</hi> when hee had gone ſo farre in putting ſo many of the <hi>Amalekits</hi> to death, yet <hi>Samuel</hi> brands him to bee a <hi>Rebel</hi> in ſo doing, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion is as the ſin of Witch-craft, &amp;c.</hi> yea, there is never a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner but ſeeks to take away the being of God, or at leaſt to pull him out of his throne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God;</hi> the fool there, is every unregenerate man, his ſaying there is no God, is his thought, that is, to take away his very being as farre as he is able; a wicked man is not only content that there ſhould bee no God, or wiſhes that there were no God (which is a monſtrous and horrid villany) but he concludes it peremptorily in himſelf there is no God, and walks accordingly: yea, and whereas Gods Throne ſhould be in the heart, he thruſts him out from thence, by ſuch godleſſe principles as this is. I might enlarge this, and clearly demonſtrate unto you, how that ſin overthrows all the Divine properties; his Mercy which it abuſes, his Juſtice which it denies, his Truth which it belyeth, his Holineſſe which it makes like it ſelf, &amp;c. and the Lord may well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it, that he is <hi>preſſed under it, as a Cart that is full of ſheaves; yea, that he is broken with our whoriſh hearts departing from him, &amp;c.</hi> Now let every ſoul that hears this, Judge impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, how it can bee poſſible that the Lord of Hoſts, the King of glory, ſhould pardon them, that doe willingly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſuch evident oppoſition againſt him; and all that you have heard, and much more may be ſaid to bee in every ſin, wherefore it cannot bee without violation of Gods Nature, that ſin ſhould paſſe unpuniſhed, or that no ſatisfaction at all ſhould be required by this Divine Juſtice for it: can Juſtice ceaſe to be juſt? then truth may bee turned into a lye, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:168555:134"/>holineſſe into wickedneſſe, and God may ceaſe to be God.</p>
            <p>Briefly, though ſin be not infinite as God is, for then God could not overcome it; yet it is in ſome ſort infinite, in the <hi>malignity</hi> of it, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. that it is <gap reason="foreign">

Now theſe are Satans plots by which hee deceives ſouls. 1 To procure them ſecrecy, and ſucceſſe in their wicked enterprizes; for ſecrecy, you have a place in <hi>Eſay,</hi> chapter 29.15. Their works are in the dark, and they ſay who ſeeth mee, or who knoweth us? they dig deep to hide their counſel from the Lord, much more from me (ſaith the Prophet) ſurely your turnings of things up and down ſhall bee as the Potters clay: for ſhall the work ſay of him that made it, hee made mee not?

<note place="margin">Wonder at Gods patience in forbearing ſin.</note> then won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the patience of God in forbearing of thee thus long; and grow to a ſelf-abhorring: and ſee what an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible neceſſity lies upon every ſoul, for to bee deeply humbled for ſin, and turned univerſally from it, even whilſt it is called to day; take notice of that, Jerem. 8.8. <hi>No man repenteth of his wickedneſs, ſaying, what have I done?</hi> and let that place bee verified in us, Zach. 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have peirced, and mourn.</hi> Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets that place of God the Father, and there may be
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:168555:138"/>a truth in it, that each perſon is pierced by our ſins.</p>
            <p>Oh! Therefore <hi>Mourn, as for an onely Sonne;</hi> and let us bee aſhamed that wee can mourn for every petty loſs or croſs, (Yea, ſuppoſe it were the loſs of an only Son) but cannot mourn at our peircing of Jehovah. If a man had brought confuſion or deſtruction upon the whole Creation, yet this were infinitely ſhort of the evil of ſinne, that is a wearineſſe to God himſelfe. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1.14. The Lord there complaines of the ſinnes of his people though they did ſo many coſtly duties, <hi>that hee was weary to bear them:</hi> what, cannot the infinite God bear them, and can a ſinful heart bear them? Yea, how dare a poor wretch live wilfully one hour in ſin, when as hee knows that God will not pardon it, without great Repentance: But here perhaps hee will ſhift or pervert ſome Scripture or another, to palliat his Conſcience. But now if wee thorowly underſtand and conſider the Argument I am upon, wee can finde out no way to eſcape puniſhment for our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>If this bee true, that God cannot in juſtice pardon ſin without puniſhment, God will puniſh all our ſinnes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our own Perſons, or in our Surety. When I ſay God cannot let ſin paſs unpuniſhed, the Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God cannot do that which is contrary to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor change his Nature, it were a contradiction to conceit this. It is ſaid in the ſecond of <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2.13. <hi>God cannot deny himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> And ſhall a Sinner then dare to live one hour in ſuch an eſtate, that (if God do not, or cannot deny himſelf) if hee dye in it, hee ſhall infallibly bee damned? Doe not go away now and ſay, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chapt. 20. verſe the laſt, <hi>Do they not ſay of mee, O Lord God, doth not this man speak Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Friends, this is no parable that I Preach, but a plain Truth, and undeniable, and therefore if you are rational, you muſt needs yeeld to the ſtrength of theſe things.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If there bee ſo much evil in ſin, then let us ſet our ſtrength againſt it, and all the temptations of Satan, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:168555:138"/>by hee labours to draw us into it. I might here tell you of the danger of ſinne, how that death is the wages ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that eternal fire ſhall bee the portion of all impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners.</p>
            <p>But Brethren, it is a ſtronger Argument, when I tell you that it is contrary to God; and this is true, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of great ſinnes, but alſo of ſmall, as it is ſin, thoſe little ſinnes (as wee term them) even vain thoughts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. and Idle words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36. do expoſe you to Eternal Wrath, not onely a prophane Converſation, but alſo a vain Converſation will prove thy deſtruction, without a Redeemer, and therefore Chriſt dyed for this end, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from (the danger of) <hi>our vain Converſation,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.19. from the waſting or miſ-ſpending of our time.</p>
            <p>It was a pretious Reſolution of <hi>Joſeph, Geneſis</hi> 39.9. <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſinne againſt my God?</hi> hee ſpeaketh, it is true, of Adultery, which is a great wickedneſſe, but his Argument to reſiſt will as well hold, to reſiſt even the leaſt ſinne; How ſhall I ſin againſt God? yea, conclude certainly, that though all ſins are not equal, yet they agree all in this, that God hates them, and cannot but in his juſtice puniſh them, and there is abundance of evil in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin, Rom. 5.20. <hi>Where ſin aboundeth grace doth ſuper-abound,</hi> he ſpeaketh there of all the ſins of the Elect. Every ſin abounds with wickedneſſe. Oh Beloved, ſuffer the word of Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Heb. 12.5. <hi>Reſiſt ſin unto blood,</hi> much more to ſhame, or diſgrace, or poverty, &amp;c. 2 Hate that which hates God, Pſa. 139.21, 22. <hi>Do not I hate them that hate thee?</hi> 3 Get the love of God into your hearts, then yee will hate ſin indeed. Pſal. 97.10. <hi>All yee that love the Lord, hate evil.</hi> 4 Labour to know God to bee your God, and then you will know what it is to ſin againſt him. Pſal. 143.10. <hi>Teach mee to do thy will, for thou art my God;</hi> if ye look upon God as a ſtranger, as one in whom you have no intereſt, then you will not bee careful how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void ſinning againſt him.</p>

<note place="margin">Satisfied juſtice the ſtrongeſt comfort to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</note> It may ſerve for an invincible ground of comfort to every true beleever, every ſoul that is in Chriſt Jeſus, that hee is juſtified by the ſtricteſt juſtice of God. And as for thoſe that are not in Chriſt, let them ſtand by, and behold with lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation their eſtrangement from theſe conſolations; yet let them admire and long for, and deſire theſe heavenly injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that belong unto the Saints: though for the preſent (poor ſouls) they are in the condition of ſuch as have no part or fellowſhip in this buſineſſe. It was a ſad ſpeech that was ſpoken by the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> to the unbeleeving Lord,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:168555:139"/>2 <hi>King.</hi> 7.2. about the great plenty in <hi>Samaria, Thou ſhalt ſee it with thine eyes, but thou ſhalt not eat thereof.</hi> I will not dare to ſpeak this concerning any that hears this word; but this is ſure, that for the preſent, whilſt men abide in the ſtate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and impenitency, it will bee extreme preſumption and deluſion, for ſuch an one to conceit any intereſt in this conſolation.</p>
            <p>The Comfort ſtands in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Comf.</hi> 1. In the bleſſedneſſe of that eſtate, and the ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ground thereof; the bleſſedneſſe of this eſtate ſtands in the pardon of ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whoſe unrighteouſneſs is forgiven, &amp;c.</hi> It is commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an eaſie matter to obtain forgiveneſſe of ſins, and there is none ſo vile but hee will preſently conceit, that hee can get it, when he is giving up the ghoſt; but ſuch perſons know not what ſuch a mercy coſts, nor what is requiſite on their parts to the injoying of it, nor what a mighty power of God is exerciſed in forgiving ſin. See how <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, when the people had ſinned, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.16, 19. <hi>Now let the power of my Lord be great, as thou haſt ſaid;</hi> the Lord is long-ſuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and by no means clearing the guilty, &amp;c. Pardon I beſeech thee the iniquity of this people, according to the greatneſſe of thy mercy. Gods omnipotent power in all his Attributes, is put forth in forgiving of ſin, and in ſpecial the greatneſſe of his mercy and juſtice; ſurely this muſt needs bee of great uſe and worth to beleevers, in ſo much that it is ſo ſtrongly built, and that on a rock of eternity; for it is built on the juſtice, truth, and mercy of God. <hi>Righteouſneſſe and peace kiſſe each other, mercy and truth meet together in the beleevers juſtification,</hi> Pſa. 85.9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Comf.</hi> 2. That which is the greateſt terrour in the world to unbeleevers, is the ſtrongeſt ground of comfort to beleevers, that is, the Juſtice and the Wrath of God againſt ſin. Look how it was, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.4, 5. when the Angel appeared at the Reſurrection of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>The keepers were affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and became as dead men;</hi> but it was ſaid to the women, <hi>Fear not yee, for yee ſeek for Jeſus of Nazareth that was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> So it is much more in this caſe, when Gods Juſtice is
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:168555:140"/>powerfully manifeſted, the ſinners of <hi>Sion</hi> and of the world are affraid and terrified; but yee poor beleevers ſeek for Chriſt who was crucified, yee need not fear any thing, yea you may be wonderfully cheared at this, and it is your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt comfort that you have to deal with this juſt God, who hath already received ſatisfaction for your ſins; for <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.3, 4. it is the ſubſtance of the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Lamb, wherein the Saints triumph in the juſtice and judgements of God, that are moſt terrible to Gods enemies. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.26, 28. where the Day of Judgement is deſcribed, and that in it there ſhall bee diſtreſſe of Nations, and mens hearts failing them for fear, <hi>viz.</hi> (of the Juſtice and Wrath of God) Why ſo? it is for looking after thoſe things that are to come upon the earth, for the powers of the earth ſhall bee ſhaken, &amp;c. but when theſe things begin to come to paſſe, <hi>then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth near.</hi> This day is the moſt dreadful day that ever was in the world to all the ungodly, but the juſt, and the faithful then ſhall bee able to lift up their heads, to ſee all the world on a light fire about them, and all the Elements in terrible confuſion. But how dare a poor Creature lift up his head in ſuch a caſe as this? <hi>They ſhall ſee the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory;</hi> here is enough to comfort the poor members of Chriſt, to ſee Chriſt on whom they have beleeved, and who hath ſatisfied Gods juſtice for them, to appear to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.1. <hi>Comfort yee, comfort yee my people, ſaith the Lord, ſpeak yee comfortably to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and ſay unto her, that her warfare is accompliſhed, that her iniquity is pardoned, for ſhe hath received at the Lords hands double for her ſins,</hi> i. e. this conflict with the wrath of God is at an end; the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their iniquity is accepted, they have received in their Head and Surety Chriſt Jeſus, double for their ſins, <hi>i. e.</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice hath paſt upon them in their Head Chriſt Jeſus, and they be ſure the Judge of all the world will doe right, and will not puniſh ſins twice. So that although they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted altogether from Gods fatherly Chaſtiſements, and afflicting hand in this life, yet there ſhall bee no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto them: the exactneſſe of Gods Juſtice cannot doe this. <hi>Job</hi> 38.10, 11, 12. <hi>Farre be is from the Almighty, that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:168555:140"/>hee ſhould doe wickedneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> It would be rightly accounted great injuſtice in a Magiſtrate to puniſh the ſame offence twice, therefore much leſſe can God be guilty of it.</p>

               <hi>Comf.</hi> 3. This ſerveth to anſwer all cavills and objections, (though there were Millions of them) that can bee made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the good eſtate of a beleever. That is a precious truth, that alone overthrows all contrary errours. Such is this, that our ſins are pardoned, not only in a way of truth and mercy, but in a way of juſtice. Sathan and our own Conſciences will object many things againſt our comfort, if we plead only the mercy and the truth of God, and will ſay, but where is then the Juſtice of God? Can Mercy pardon without the conſent of his Juſtice? but now whilſt we beleeve in Chriſts ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>justice and peace kiſſe each other;</hi> yea juſtice ſaith, I am pleaſed. Many things will bee caſt in our diſh in the day of temptation, about the multitude and greatneſſe of our ſins, and our manifold grievous relapſes; but <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from all iniquity;</hi> hee hath paid the full price that juſtice could exact or require, and we may ſay, as it is in <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Mercy</hi> (coming through ſaith) <hi>rejoyceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Comf.</hi> 4. This is the ſpecial favour of the Spouſe of Chriſt, that they can plead the righteouſneſſe of God in Chriſt, as the Lord ſaith, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever, yea I will betroth thee unto me in rightteouſneſſe, and in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in loving kindneſſe,</hi> i. e. in free grace pittying our miſerable condition, and in faithfulneſſe and truth perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his promiſes that he hath made; but is that all? No, but hee will doe it in <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> too, that is, in a way whereby he will declare his juſtice, as well as his mercy and truth. This is the ſure match that the Lord hath made with a poor ſoul, which will ſtand good, not only in the Court of Chancery, but in the Court of Juſtice, or Common Pleas too. Such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable match hath the Lord made with a poor beleever, and how then can he break off from it, to leave the ſoul in a ſtate of Widdowhood? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt bee no more termed forſaken, but thou ſhalt bee called Hephſibah, for the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in thee.</hi>

            <pb n="227" facs="tcp:168555:141"/>
            <p n="1">1 If pardon of ſin is given, and muſt be received in a way of juſtice as well as in a way of mercy and truth; then let every ſoul ſeek pardon of God in ſuch a way as may ſtand with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice. There is many a condemned Malefactor ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the barre, that cries for mercy in vain at the hands of the Judge, not conſidering the place of the Judge, which is to doe juſtice. So it fareth with many convicted and awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſinners, they goe to God in ſuch a <hi>natural way,</hi> as <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad</hi> went to <hi>Ahab,</hi> ſaying, The Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> wee have heard are merciful Kings, ſo they ſay, we have heard the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a merciful God, I will goe to him with ſackcloath about my loyns, and ropes about my neck, <hi>i.e.</hi> with Humiliation and Self-judging, and I hope that hee will pardon me. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Lord, this is needful, and commendable, and I would not diſcourage any one from it; but the diſtreſſed ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is forced to it by the ſenſe of his miſery and ſome natural inſtinct, and indeed alone it is inſufficient to prevail with God, unleſſe he can plead his juſtice too as well as his mercy. Thence you finde that God is deſcribed ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.21. <hi>There is no God elſe beſides me, a juſt God, and a Saviour,</hi> i. e. none beſides me that is a juſt God in ſaving of ſinners; hee ſo ſaves as that hee may be juſt ſtill, and none can ſave ſo beſides this juſt God, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22, 23. <hi>Truly in vain is ſalvation hoped for from the hills, and the multitude of the mountains; in the Lord our God is the ſalvation of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for ſhame hath devoured the labours of our fathers, and we lye down in their ſhame, for we have ſinned againſt the Lord our God.</hi> It is but a vain thing for you to take pains, to goe to any other for ſalvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this juſt God, and if ever he ſave you, it will be in a way of juſtice.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is that way of juſtice, that we muſt expect juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is or can be but one way (that was ever heard of) to ſatisfie the juſtice of God, that ſinners might bee juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>i.e.</hi> by the Father's making his own Son a <hi>propitiation</hi> for them, that is the myſtery in the text, that God forgiveth ſins through the <hi>bloud</hi> of his Son; and beloved, conſider that <hi>Luther</hi> took a great deal of pains to underſtand this, and prayed much and earneſtly to the Lord for it, before he could
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:168555:141"/>get the right meaning of it. The myſtery is this, That the Son of God manifeſted in the fleſh, muſt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, to ſatisfie Divine juſtice, or elſe all Mankind muſt periſh eternally. Then if this bee ſo, let every one ſee the great neceſſity of getting into Chriſt, and accordingly fly without delay to the Lord Jeſus. Let me ſay to thee, as it was ſaid to <hi>Lot,</hi> Eſcape for thy life, neither ſtay, &amp;c. leſt thou bee conſumed; deliver thy ſelf as a Roe from the hands of the Hunter, or as a Bird from the hand of the Fowler. My thinks, this Argument ſhould fire every ſinful man out of his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate, and make him fill Heaven and Earth with cries, that he may gain Chriſt; yea my thinks, the Lord ſeemes to take the Lingerers by the hand, as he did <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 19.16. <hi>The Lord being merciful to them,</hi> to bring them to Chriſt. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments whereby I would preſſe this upon poor ſinners are, The urgent and extreme neceſſity of a Redeemer for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not only becauſe the Scripture cannot be broken, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.35. which ſaith, <hi>Without ſhedding of bloud there is no remiſſion,</hi> Heb: 9.22. Beſides, there is no pardon of ſin, but in the New Teſtament, and where a Teſtament is, there muſt needs be the death of the Teſtator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16. or elſe the Teſtament is of no force; Nor only the neceſſity of Gods unchangeable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, who chuſeth every ſoul that ſhall bee ſaved in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. and theſe are inviolable things: but this is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſſity that now I muſt needs put you in mind of, <hi>i.e.</hi> the <hi>neceſsity of Gods nature,</hi> that he is ſo juſt, that hee can by no means acquit or clear the guilty. Look how impoſſible it is that the God of truth ſhould lye, or the holy God ſhould ſin, or Almighty God ſhould be weak; ſo it is that the moſt juſt God ſhould pardon ſin, to them that are without Chriſt, yea know, how impoſſible it is that any thing ſhould act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its nature, as our Saviour reaſons, <hi>Doe men gather grapes of thorns? &amp;c.</hi> yet the Lord of Nature can, and hath changed the nature of inferiour Agents, becauſe his is above them; but it cannot be conceived (without blaſphemy) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the unchangeable Nature of God, he ſaith, <hi>I am Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, I change not,</hi> Mal. 3.6. He is that eternal being that is ever the ſame; and if ſo, then thou muſt bee a member of Chriſt, and ſo anſwer juſtice, even the juſtice of God by the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:168555:142"/>Surety, or elſe thou muſt certainly bee the everlaſting object of Divine vengeance; and obſerve examples and expreſſions of Scripture to this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>If God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to Hell, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them unto chains of darkneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Mark the words, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels before their fall were moſt glorious Creatures, and had God pardoned &amp; reſtored one of them, he might have done God more ſervice than many millions of men, but them hee ſpared not, he abated nothing at all, but caſt them down to Hell, and put them into everlaſting chains. But why did not God ſpare them? why? becauſe they had no Chriſt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Gods juſtice for them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Chriſt took not on him the nature of Angels.</hi> Again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.21. <hi>If God ſpared not the natural branches</hi> (the Jewes) <hi>take heed leſt he ſpare not alſo thee.</hi> Suppoſe thou art in the number of them that profeſs the name of God, as the Jewes did; ſuppoſe thou art a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the viſible Church, yet God will not ſpare thee, no more than the Jewes. Why ſhould he not ſpare his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that had ſo many priviledges? <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, 5. Oh beloved, the reaſon is, becauſe they received not Chriſt, they were broken off, and though you think of your ſelves as well, as of the greateſt that ever ſinned, the juſt God (except you get Chriſt) will not, cannot ſpare you. Adde that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>He ſpared not his own Son,</hi> being a Surety for ſin. What? was God without natural affection, or was hee cruel? No, but Chriſt was now bound by an ingagement to his Fathers Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and therefore God ſpared him not, ſhall any cloſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hope then to be ſpared? Now let me bring theſe things to the reſult of them, and it is this, That in ſome caſes all deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration is excluded; as 1 Where there is but one poſſible means or way of ſafety, deliberation is uſed when there are many wayes or means, which is the beſt that wee may take. 2 In caſe of imminent danger, where without this means there is abſolute impoſſibility of eſcaping deſtruction. 3 In caſe of extreme preſent neceſſity: as in caſe of violent ſtorms, the Mariner doth not deliberate whether he ſhould throw out his Treaſure, or cut down his Maſts for the ſaving of his life, and the lives of all that are in the Veſſel with him; in theſe caſes all deliberation is vain, by the very light of nature and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:168555:142"/>reaſon. Now in the buſineſſe in hand all theſe doe meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to exclude all deliberation. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1 There is but one way to appeaſe wrath, and ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. and there had not been this way, except that God of his grace had given it.

Oh then, tender all the pay together, all the obedience of Chriſt, active and paſſive; tender we to the righteouſneſſe of God the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, it is ſuch a jewel as exceeds our ſins infinitely, though they have been very many and great, Gods juſtice ſhall be no loſer by us at all, and let poor beleevers incourage and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden their hearts with this; <hi>Luther</hi> was bold when he prayed thus, not only <hi>Fiat voluntas tua,</hi> but <hi>Fiat voluntas mea;</hi> not only let thy will be done, but let my will be done, and it was but the confidence of faith upon this ground we are ſpeaking of. Oh beloved, the world will account this malepertneſſe to come thus before God, that they are more bold than welcome, but they are ſtrangers to theſe things, and to all that liberty we have in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.4. It would be ſaucineſs indeed for thoſe that are out of Chriſt, to approach at any time on this manner to God, but let the Children take this as the daily portion of the Childrens bread, and it is no wrong to that text, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. to take it in this ſenſe, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is juſt</hi> (for Chriſts ſake) <hi>to forgive us our ſins,</hi> nor to that, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſſe.</hi>

If God be thus juſt, exactly juſt in the juſtification of a Sinner, let us learn to acknowledge and adore the righteouſneſs of God in all his wayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.17. If his mercy doth not pardon one ſin, but in a courſe of juſtice through the death of Chriſt, then doubtleſſe the Juſtice of God will not be baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or turned aſide in the managing other matters in the world. The light of Nature ſees nothing but mercy in this caſe, but the light of Grace ſees Gods juſtice alſo. So that though God deals otherwiſe many times, in many things, than we could have expected, or can ſee a reaſon of; yet he is always juſt and holy in his proceedings, and it is not enough for us to acknowledge the righteouſneſſe and holineſſe of God
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:168555:144"/>in ſome of his ways and works, or in his ways towards others, and not towards our ſelves, and in his dealing with ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and not with all; but wee muſt juſtifie the Lord in our hearts and words always, in all things, toward all, in all the ways of his providences, in his afflicting the godly, as well as puniſhing the wicked, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13. yea in the proſperity of the wicked; In his great Counſels of Election and Reprobation, in the rejection of the Jews, &amp;c. of which when <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. he concludes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 36. and cryes out, <hi>Oh the depth of the wiſdome of God, &amp;c.</hi> So let us alwayes doe when we cannot trace God in his wayes, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.14. <hi>God hath ſet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and adverſity the one over againſt the other, to the end that no man ſhould finde any thing after him;</hi> i. e. that none ſhould ſee the print of his ſteps. When God deals thus, and his ways are over-clouded by us, never let us quarrel or cavil at any paſſage of his providence, but let us fall down and adore the righteouſneſſe of the Lord, and judge him, not according to outward appearance, but ſay, <hi>How unſearchable are thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.19. <hi>Thy righteouſneſſe, O God, is very high, &amp;c.</hi> and truly beyond the reach of men and Angels, <hi>thou hast done great things, oh God, who is like unto thee? thou haſt ſhewed me great and ſore troubles, and ſhalt quicken me again, and raiſe me up from the depths of the earth.</hi> So when God viſiteth the ſins of the Fathers upon the Children, acknowledge Gods righteouſneſſe in it, for Children are part of their Parents, and it is juſt with God to puniſh ſuch as hate him, when and where he pleaſeth. Beſides, many times children approve of the ſins of their Parents, and imitate them, and doe worſe than they, as <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> Dan. 8.22. So when God gives grace to ſome, and denies it to others, that are alike ſinful, this ſeems harſh to <hi>Arminians,</hi> and carnal perſons, but God ſaith, <hi>Shall I not doe what I will with mine own?</hi> Mat. 20.13.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This point lies clear in the Text, and it is that which is ſignifyed by that ſpeech, that is ſo often uſed in all the great works of God, eſpecially his Mercies to his people, and his Judgements upon his Enemies, this is ſtill mentioned, as the end that God aims at, in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel, That yee may know, that I am the Lord;</hi> that is, Juſt, Holy, Merciful, and Faithful, &amp;c. and ſuch a one as I have revealed my ſelf to be: it is expreſſed excellently, Jerem. 9.23, 24. <hi>Let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſdome, &amp;c. but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that hee underſtandeth and knoweth mee, that I am Jehovah, which exerciſe loving kindneſſe, judgement and righteouſneſſe in the earth, for in theſe things I delight.</hi> The true knowledge of God, is a matter of wonderful worth, and it is not onely to know him to bee a God that <hi>exerciſes loving kindneſs,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Judgement and Righteouſneſſe, in the earth,</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe in <hi>theſe things the Lord delighteth.</hi> Theſe things are according to the nature and heart of God. Now mark, that the Lord would have us to know him to bee ſuch a God, and to glory in this: for this is the happineſs of a poor creature. Now that you may know how pertinent this is to the matter in hand, yee may compare with it, 1 Cor. 1.30, 31. where it is ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt is made unto us of God, wiſdome, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſanctification, and redemption, that according as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord.</hi> Whence there is evidently a reference to that place of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy.</hi> So that to put both places together, there will bee this collection from them; <hi>That God the Father hath appointed and ſent the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to bee the Head and Fountain of all spiritual bleſſings, and especially of righteouſneſſe to the faithful,</hi> that they
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:168555:146"/>may know him to bee <hi>Jehovah that exerciſeth loving kindneſs, judgement and righteouſneſs in the earth,</hi> to ſtrip all the Children of Men of all glorying in themſelves, and to cauſe them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe all the glory to the Lord,</p>

<note place="margin">The Doctrin of Gods juſtice is ſutable to the Goſpel.</note> It may ſerve to diſcover and confute the general miſtake and error about the Doctrin of the Goſpel: Truely, the Lord hath dealt graciouſly with us in the times of the New Teſtament, and eſpecially with his people in theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, wherein the Grace of God, and the Riches therof, are more abundantly ſounded forth; and magnified above former ages: and moſt bleſſed is the eſtate of thoſe veſſels of Grace, the perſons that receive it in truth, and are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers thereof; but beloved, I do very much fear, leſt that Satan get advantage by this means to make innumerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to miſs their mark, and Gods mark too, cauſing them utterly to pervert the doctrine of the Goſpel, and the grace of God, and his principal plot and purpoſe therein, ſo as to cauſe many to forget and diſanul in their thoughts and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God, as though it were altogether <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneal, Heterodox,</hi> and impertinent to the myſtery of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Now I beſeech you, that yee would bee convinced of this, whatſoever yee forget, that there is more of the juſtice of God declared and demonſtrated in the Goſpel, and Goſpel myſteries thereof, than there is in the Law. I might tell you of thoſe dreadful Threatnings againſt them that ſin againſt the Goſpel. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. where there is a far heavier puniſhment denounced againſt the Goſpel ſins and ſinners, than there ever was againſt the tranſgreſſions or tranſgreſſors of the Law; and if wee look into Examples, it is true, that there were heavy puniſhments inflicted in the times of the Old Teſtament, as the drowning of the whole World, the deſtruction of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:168555:149"/>yea, take in the rejection of the evil Angels, yet none of all theſe were comparative to the example in the text, and Heb. 1. <hi>Chriſt is ſet above the Angels, and hath a name above e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very name,</hi> yet even upon him Divine Juſtice hath paſſed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Juſtice was like this, yet this muſt go for Goſpel-ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, yea, this is the end of all that grace, that the Lord hath ſhewed in the Goſpel, and in the death of Chriſt; it is for the demonſtration of the Juſtice of God, yea, the indiſpenſable Juſtice of God: The Lord would convince all the World in the Tenor of the Goſpel, how terrible his Juſtice and his Wrath is. That is very remarkable. Rom. 1.17, 18. <hi>That in the Gospel the Righteouſneſs of God is revealed from Faith to Faith.</hi> Even ſince that, in the ſame Goſpel, <hi>The wrath of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven againſt all unrighteouſneſſe and ungodlineſs of men, &amp;c.</hi> why, but was not Gods Wrath revealed in the Old Teſtament? Truely, the Text ſhews that it was never ſo cleared and demonſtrated before. Now let mee adde this, that the Text holds forth in thoſe words <hi>[at this time]</hi> what time was that time, but the time of the Goſpel? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Spirit of God intimates, that there would bee mighty need (and more than ever) in the ſecure times of the Goſpel, that the Juſtice of God ſhould bee manifeſted: now many will think, that ſince the death of Chriſt nothing but the <hi>Grace</hi> of God ſhould bee heard of, and that it would be accounted Legal Preaching, to tell the people of the Juſtice of God, but even at this time, behold, I ſay in theſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton times of the Goſpel, behold, that God would have his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice declared, more than ever in former times, and ſay not, that in the Goſpel times, this juſtice, as executed onely upon Chriſt, is declared: for though that bee true in regard of the members of Chriſt; yet doubtleſſe as for others; no doubt but the ſtate of <hi>Chorazin and Bethſaida, Tyre and Sidon</hi> is far worſe than the ſtate of unbeleevers and impenitent perſons in the times of the Old Teſtament; I do willingly receive and imbrace the difference betwixt the Law and Goſpel, held forth by the Proteſtant divines; that free grace and remiſſion of ſins is promiſed and beſtowed in the Goſpel upon all beleevers, <hi>Joh</hi> 3.16. which the Law ſtrictly taken, mentions not, yet the contempt or neglect of this grace, being a greater ſin than
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:168555:150"/>any other, muſt needs bring an heavier weight of juſtice upon them that are guilty thereof. Let all this ſerve to rectify our judgement, concerning the main Scope of the Goſpel, which is not onely to ſet forth Gods infinite grace in Chriſt, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to demonſtrate his juſtice againſt ſin.</p>

If that the Lord had forgiven ſinners, without any more adoe, of his meer will and Grace, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny price or ranſome, this eaſy way of forgiveneſs (prated of by the <hi>Socinians</hi> and Carnal Goſpellers) would in no ſort have ſo declared or demonſtrated the infinite love of God to the Elect, as this doth, that when as God the Father with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence and wrong, to his juſt and holy nature (I may ſpeak it with reverence) could not pardon one ſin by his grace, yet in his admirable wiſdome and grace, hee hath been at that coſt to give his Sons blood to bee a ranſome for ſin, that juſtice may have its due courſe. This is the meaning of that, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. wee are juſtified freely by his grace through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Jeſus Chriſt: this is admirable grace, and free grace indeed; All the Angels in Heaven, and men on earth may bee aſtoniſhed at this.

            <p>Object. <hi>It is prophanely and wickedly objected by Hereticks in this caſe, that if Chriſt dyed for ſinners, then the Sons love to us far exceeded the Fathers love, the Father deals rigorouſly with ſinners, but the Son laies down his life for them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">God the fathers love to the faithful in ſcripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and divers effects.</note>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:168555:150"/>More particularly, to root out all ſuch evil ſurmiſes, ſee what courſe the Scripture takes to diſcover the Fathers love in this whole myſtery, which is by all means to bee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and adored.</p>

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:168555:151"/>but therefore I ſpeak theſe things, to ſhew that a carnal heart hath no juſt cauſe from the Scripture to make or conceit any diſparity in the divine ſubſiſtence.</p>

               <note place="margin">This was Preached in a ſick time.</note> and thou haſt yet no ſanctuary or place of refuge to hide thy ſelf in: yea, that Juſtice is riding circuit in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and goes from houſe to houſe, yea, from perſon to perſon; yea, this Goſpel juſtice, which is the moſt terrible, which muſt ſtand at the bar to anſwer it in their own perſons: and let not any pleaſe themſelves with their priviledges or profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, call that to minde, <hi>Zephan.</hi> 3.5. which is ſpoken of Gods people of old, <hi>The juſt God is in the midſt of them, every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he brings his judgements to light; but the unjuſt knows no ſhame.</hi> Oh beloved, this the Lord will do even ſtill, that judgement ſhall begin at the houſe of God.</p>
            <p>Now take a few Conſiderations,</p>
            <p n="1">1 That now in the times of the Goſpel it is in vain for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man to plead ignorance of Gods juſtice,
<note place="margin">Conſiderations and directions to hard-hearted ſinners.</note> ſeeing that it is ſo ſolemnly publiſhed and declared.</p>
            <p n="2">2 No man can now doubt of it, ſeeing that in Chriſts death there is ſuch a manifeſt token and demonſtration of it, yee may bee ſure that Gods threatnings againſt ſin are in good earneſt, when hee makes ſuch execution.</p>
            <p n="3">3 There bee very few that do know the juſtice of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven amongſt Profeſſors; what means that heavenly Prayer, Joh. 17.25? <hi>Righteous Father the World, hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and theſe have known that thou haſt ſent mee:</hi> hee ſpeaks of God as a righteous Father even towards himſelf, which none of the world knows, and hee doth evidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or comprehend the Jews in that world, though the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4 If juſtice bee not ſatisfied, and anger with-drawn, <hi>all thy proud Helpers will stoop under him;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 4.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Queſt. <hi>What courſe ſhould a poor ſinner take in this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 Let him conclude undoubtedly with his own ſoul, that there is abundance of unrighteouſneſſe in every ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:168555:152"/>by him, much more in all his ſins together: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Gods juſtice proceeds ſo ſeverely againſt imputed ſin. Gods juſtice and judicial proceedings do clearly diſcover, and are directly oppoſed to the unrighteouſneſs of ſin; therefore labour by all means to ſee, by the conſideration of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, what abundance of unrighteouſneſſe there is in ſin. Ponder that place well, Rom. 5.20. <hi>Where ſin abounds, there grace abounds much more, but the Law entred that ſin might abound.</hi> The Law ſhews, that there is abundance of wickedneſſe in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin, do not think that it belongs onely to ſome kinde of ſins of an hainous nature, for it belongs to all ſins whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, being tranſgreſſions of Gods Law, as the Text is clear: therefore do not ſleight any ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Bee ſure that God is exceeding willing that his juſtice ſhould bee ſatisfied in and by the Surety, and hee would not have poor ſinners to indure the brunt, and the intollerable burthen of it: thou maieſt in the ſaddeſt thoughts of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſtay up thy heart with this: that Chriſts death was as well for remiſſion of ſins, as to declare the juſtice of God: yea, and though ſin abounds, yet Grace abounds much more.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Remember alſo, that this juſtice is ſatisfied in the death of Chriſt for ſins of all ſorts and degrees. I might tell you of multitudes, for <hi>Davids</hi> Murther and Adultery; for <hi>Pauls</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and blaſphemy; for the <hi>Corinthians</hi> Theft, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Drunkenneſs, Extortion, reviling, unnatural Luſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10, 11. Thence it is ſaid, 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>That Chriſt was made ſin for us,</hi> that is, <hi>all manner of ſin was imputed unto him;</hi> yea, and he was made a ſacrifice for all manner of ſin without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on the behalf of all beleevers: this may much incourage a poor ſinner to fly to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Faith in Chriſts blood (ſo it bee of the right kind) though never ſo weak, is the means to bring home the ſatisfaction of Chriſt. I have ſpoken of it before, and (alſo that wee ought eſpecially to attend unto) that faith of the right kinde ſeems to bee deſcribed by that phraſe <hi>[The juſtifier of him, that is, of the Faith of Jeſus]</hi> that may imply two things. Firſt, That true faith is a ſeparating and diſtinguiſhing grace, as when the Jews are ſaid <hi>to bee of the Circumciſion,</hi> Gal. 2.12. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.11.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:168555:152"/>it is ſpoken to diſtinguiſh them from all others; Alas! That is a poor faith that makes no diſtinction between a beleever and an unbeleever, a ruffian, and a Saint. 2 The phraſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a powerful and efficacious faith, that overſwaies the whole man, and the whole Courſe; ſo that hee may bee ſaid to be of the faith. So Gal. 3.9. <hi>They which be of the faith are bleſſed with faithful</hi> Abraham; that is, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was of the faith, I mean efficaciouſly for kind, though not for degree; ſee that ye be not miſtaken in this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 5. Exhortation to beleevers in three branches.
<note place="margin">Beleevers ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and claim their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</note> 1 Let it perſwade them, now to underſtand their good eſtate, and boldly to claim their priviledge: their good eſtate is ſuch as is very pretious in theſe times. I may tell them of that, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.12. and teſtify (as <hi>Peter</hi> did) that this is the true grace of God wherein yee ſtand: much is ſpoken in theſe daies of the grace of God, but I fear many will find at the laſt, that the grace they truſt in will not bee found the true grace of God: neither will they ſtand in it: but the beleevers eſtate that builds upon his union with Chriſt, and his communion with him in Gods juſtice ſatisfied, is that which will ſtand, and the beleever ſhall ſtand by it.</p>
            <p>Now hereupon humbly and boldly <hi>claim a diſcharge</hi> from ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied juſtice upon all occaſions, in infirmities, relapſes, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, deſertions, and ſinkings of heart; lay claim to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt demonſtration of the juſtice and mercy of God in Chriſts death, for both are here wrapped together, and our ground is, 1 Joh. 2.1, 2. <hi>Little Children, theſe things I write unto you that ye ſin not, if any man ſin, we have an advocate with the Father, and a Propitiation, &amp;c.</hi> every Child of God (though but a little one) and ſuch an one as makes conſcience not to ſin, may have daily recourſe to this Propitiation, <hi>where mercy and juſtice meet.</hi> Theſe bee the wings of God (as it were) that with <hi>David</hi> wee ſhould make our refuge in the worſt times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.1.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Let us eternally celebrate the name of God in Chriſt,
<note place="margin">They ſhould praiſe the name of God in Chriſt.</note> his juſtice, mercy holineſs, wiſdom, providence, &amp;c. for his glory in all theſe things, is the laſt end of all theſe diſpenſations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, this therefore ſhould bee adored by us, and <hi>by theſe things wee live,</hi> wee may take up <hi>Davids</hi> Song of mercy and judgement in this ſenſe alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.1. and adde
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:168555:153"/>that, Pſal. 17.15. <hi>My mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy righteouſneſſe and ſalvation all the day, for I know not the numbers thereof. David</hi> was a good Arithmetician in counting Gods mercies &amp; judgements, hath his new Songs ſtill for renewed mercies, but he is fain to confeſſe, that his Arithmetick fails him, <hi>hee cannot ſum up the numbers</hi> thereof: ſo wee may ſay, we cannot number things. God hath and ſhould have all his glory in the Saints. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Let this bee an ingagement to us,
<note n="3" place="margin">They ſhould bee righteous, as God.</note> to be <hi>righteous, as our heavenly Father is righteous;</hi> that is, to follow the pattern of Gods righteouſneſſe. Oh beloved! if the Lord hath thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and glorified himſelf to us in a way of righteouſneſs, and if it coſt him ſo dear to ſhew himſelf both juſt and merciful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, what an inviolable bond is this to us to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before him, and to glorify Gods righteouſneſſe in a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous converſation, in righteous dealing and judging, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing continually? yea, let us declare and demonſtrate this before God and men, yea, make it our end, as the Lord makes it his.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Let us do it at <hi>This time;</hi> Now when there is ſo much unrighteouſneſs among Profeſſors, as it is ſaid of <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 6.9. <hi>That</hi> Noah <hi>was a juſt man, and perfect in his generation,</hi> that is, the worſt Generation that <hi>ever water wet:</hi> ſo though the Generation wee live in, be very bad, yet let us labour to be juſt in it, for they muſt be ſuch that would bee ſheltered in this Ark, when the floods of error, and ſin and wrath do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow all.</p>
            <p>Finally, let me conclude with that, Hoſ. 10.12. <hi>Sow to your ſelves, in righteouſneſſe, and reap in mercy, break up your fallow ground, for it is time to ſeek the Lord, till hee come and rain down righteouſneſſe upon you;</hi> the ſeed of righteouſneſſe ſown by us, ſhall bee watered with the ſhowres of Gods righteouſneſſe from heaven, and you may then conclude aſſuredly, that yee ſhall have a plentious harveſt, and crop of everlaſting mercy from the Lord.</p>
